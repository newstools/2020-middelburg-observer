 Columbus Stainless has reported its second positive Covid-19 test result after another employee at the stainless steel manufacturerâ€™s water treatment plant tested positive. CEO, Mr Johan Strydom, confirmed the first test result in a company memorandum on June 1. Columbus said in a statement that the plant would remain operational as an essential service of the steel manufacturing plant. The staff component was down scaled while protective measures were increased to protect essential employees. Mr Strydom confirmed that the cases were not related as the employees were not in the same divisions. Both had possibly contracted the virus at funerals with the first man having attended a funeral in Bloemfontein, and the second in Nasaret. The latest test result had also been reported to labour and health authorities.
