 Several religious leaders from the community have confirmed that their institutions have opted to continue with virtual services as opposed to traditional services, and do not foresee the opening of their premises any time soon. The latest amendment to the government gazette has now outfitted the institutions with a list of criteria, including the following: • No more than 50 members allowed – depending on the size of the facility.
• Congregants must be screened, temperatures read, sanitised and wear masks.
• Churches must keep a register of all attendees.
• Social distancing must be observed within pews.
• No choirs allowed, musical accompaniment must be of an electronic nature.
• No singing, dancing or movement is allowed.
• Services may not exceed an hour.
• No Sunday schools allowed.
• No socialising before or after services.
• Buildings must be sanitised after every meeting. These regulations, which may seem fairly basic, have created unique challenges for each individual institution. Reverend Anton Kemp, from the Dutch Reformed Church (Witkerk), said that the church council ultimately decided not to reopen, in the light of the majority of their members being elderly people. Their risk profile is frankly too high, and the Kranspoort Church, which falls under the denomination, is not equipped to meet all the standards. Corpus Christi and its sister church, Familia Dei, will also continue with virtual services until further notice. Dr Thela from Christ Centre Ministries said their institution, which comprises of up to 400 attendees, has chosen to continue with virtual services, “Many of our members have grown accustomed to tuning into our media platforms, and with praise and worship not being allowed, many have found that it is less effort to listen to services in the comfort of their own homes.” The Masjidus Salaam, NG Kanonkop, Lofdal Gesinskerk and Grace of Salvation Ministries are all ready to resume with services, with necessary precautionary measures in place to accommodate its members. Pastor Callie Joubert from Lofdal Gesinskerk, says they are ready to kick off with their first service this coming Sunday. With multiple services, they hope to accomodate atleast 150 congregants a week, and will continue to serve vulnerable people by means of virtual services. Many other institutions are currently in meetings with their council members and cannot confirm opening dates as yet.
