 Schools were ready and excited to welcome back Grade 7 and 12 learners with special entrances, screening stations and markers to indicate a safe social distance. At Laerskool C.R. Swart learners have to walk through a tunnel using Eco-friendly sanitizer after they have been screened at the school entrance.
Hoërskool Middelburg had Grade 12’s line up next to the rugby field whilst teachers were being screened to enter the premises.  The receiving of Grade 7’s at Middelburg Primary went well with the scholar patrol on duty to ensure everyone’s safety as they arrived to be screened. At Thusanang Primary in Mhluzi, blocks were painted on the floor to show learners what a safe distance between them should be. Learners received training about Covid-19 from a registered nurse before returning to their classes.  At St. Peter Christian College, also in Mhluzi, Grade 11 learners received training whilst Grade 12 and 7 learners were already back in class. Because it is a private school, they can welcome back other Grades as long as they adhere to Covid-19 safety regulations.  School headmaster Hanroux Hugo pulled up his sleeves and built his own paper towel dispenser at the hand wash station. The school also has a clinic, sponsored by an American company, that can quarantine five learners at one stage. The man in charge of the clinic is Bafana Motau.
