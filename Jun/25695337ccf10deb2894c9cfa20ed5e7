 The town’s avid joggers sat with their hearts in their shoes when the nationwide lockdown stole the Loskop Marathon from them and then the Comrades.
But the Rotary’s famous Greatest Train Race will – much like Freddy Mercury’s show – go on. The GTR planning committee made the day for our sportsmen and women when they announced that the GTR 2020 will take place virtually. As the committee gathered their heads to iron out the crinkles, they have now shared their latest information on the how and where. The GTR 2020 will, for the first time ever, accommodate participants in categories including running, walking and cycling. Participants may choose to take part in either one or all three of these categories, as well as competing in races of varying distances from 5km to 32 km. The virtual race will continue from 1-22 August, during which participants can register and submit their times and distances on the GTR website. Participants who complete the race will be awarded a virtual medal or certificate and may even apply for a special medal of buff.
