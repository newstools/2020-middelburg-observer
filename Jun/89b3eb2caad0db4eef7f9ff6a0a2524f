He confirmed that she passed away last week and was buried over the weekend. The woman was a teacher at a local school. She did however not return to school after the lockdown. Information from another source was that the woman’s boyfriend tested positive two weeks ago. She started feeling ill last week and was admitted to hospital on Tuesday. Jasper Zwane, spokesperson for the Mpumalanga Department of Education, said that he cannot confirm or deny whether the teacher involved was Covid positive, but he could confirm that she has not been at the school since before the March holiday.
