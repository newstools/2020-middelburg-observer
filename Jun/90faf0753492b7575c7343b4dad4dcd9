 One of the Directors confirmed the positive infection, and said that the cordoning off of the filling station was to allow for a full disinfection of their facilities. The Director informed that the Engen Filling Station is open to the public again, and assured members of the public that it is the cleanest filling station in South Africa, after the decontamination. All employees have been screened and tested, and only employees who had no direct contact with the infected person as well as negative results on their tests, are currently working. Tracing has been done, and all employees who have made direct contact have been instructed to self-isolate at home. “We have gone beyond the necessary regulations to ensure the reopening of our business and the safety of our clientele and our employees remain our primary concern.” The Director said.
