 According to a media statement, MEC Pat Ngomane stated that licensed restaurants are permitted to sell alcohol via e-commerce, for off-consumption purposes, but that they are bound by the same regulations as licensed liquor retailers. Alcohol may only be distributed to clients, along with their food order, for either call or collect, or delivery, from Mondays to Thursdays, 09:00 – 17:00. Local restaurant owners have acknowledged that they will allow patrons to place an order for alcoholic beverages along with food orders. Owner of the Dros in Middelburg, Mr Chris Silver, has confirmed that his restaurant has made this option available to customers from 1 June.
Patrons are restricted to a limit of alcohol to the value of R1 500 per order, for either delivery or collection. The business has plenty of special combos advertised on their Facebook page. Hannelin Combrink, from Ginelli’s, admits to having something exclusive on offer for their patrons. The restaurant will also be distributing alcohol along with food orders, including a range of craft brews, exceptional wines and gins and giving clients access to a more finer taste. The restaurant plans on making a visit to their premises worthwhile, by launching a one-stop restaurant, where shoppers can purchase basic groceries like milk and bread along with food and alcohol. The liquor board has not given any information on the limit of quantities for alcoholic purchases, but restaurant owners do not believe that overbuying through means of their channels will be a problem. “We are not a wholesaler and obviously won’t allow clients to purchase trailers full of alcohol from us. Our prices are somewhat increased to that of liquor retailers, and surely many restaurants will add a delivery tariff, so bulk buying won’t be worthwhile for customers,” Hannelin Combrink said.
