 Caucus leader, Mr Johann Dyason, told councillors during a virtual council sitting, in which the 2020/2021 budget was adopted, that all households were impacted by lockdown restrictions, which will result in the municipality collecting less revenue from broke ratepayers. More residents will also undoubtedly apply for rebates, with many experiencing massive pay cuts and job losses. Mr Dyason welcomed Municipal Manager Mr Bheki Khenisa’s commitment to invest heavily in municipal infrastructure while the chips are down. Mr Khenisa told the Middelburg Observer during a recent interview that the municipality has decided to invest heavily on infrastructure development, most notably in Mhluzi. “When the globe is going low, we will be going high,” he told the paper. Mr Dyason, however, urged the municipality to choose projects carefully and to spend money where it is most needed. He further implored the municipality to cut “unnecessary” expenditure like performance bonuses, catering, commemorations and other events “to the bone, or completely”. The municipality has agreed to a 6% salary raise for all employees, many of whom have still not returned to work. Mr Khenisa himself will also receive almost R800 000 in back-pay alongside councillors who did not receive their 2019/2020 salary increments.
The finance department confirmed that the salary increments owed have been secured on the new budget. Councillors and municipal management were also asked to take voluntary salary cuts to contribute to the municipality’s newly established Covid-19 relief fund, which is an independent fund with its own bank account. Meanwhile, council also agreed to the rollover of pensioner property rebate applications to the 2020/2021 financial year.
Annually, pensioners applying for rebates have to submit applications by June 30. Due to lockdown restrictions and the danger posed to the elderly by the coronavirus, rebates will continue as normal.
Pensioner rebates only apply to couples with a combined income of less than R14 400 per month. The following rebates apply for registered pensioners: • R0 to R3 600,00 (state pension x 2) = 100%
• R3 600 to R7 200 = 70%
• R7 200 to R10 800 = 50%
• R10 800 to R14 400 = 20% There are currently 1 380 pensioner households registered on the municipal property rebate list. All new applicants will be reviewed as per the property rates policy for 2020/2021.
