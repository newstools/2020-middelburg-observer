 Storme Martin says that she goes to tutor the same child at the same time every Tuesday and Friday. Last week Tuesday, as she was approaching her destination, she noticed a black car with heavily tinted windows and loud music playing approaching her from the right. The car stopped slightly behind her but no one got out. Mrs Martin said that she was still trying to figure out what was going on when her client opened the gate, so she got out of her car and walked in. “I told my client about the car outside and how strange it was,” she said. When she went back outside, her Volkswagen Citi Golf was gone. Mrs Martin said that in retrospect she is convinced that she was being watched. “I keep thinking that if my client hadn’t opened the gate, I would have been hijacked. I had the keys in my hand!” she said. The car is described as a white VW Citi Golf 1.6, 1995 model. The car’s windscreen is damaged and it has several stickers on the rear window including stickers reading “I LOVE SIMON’S TOWN” and “Onderstepoort”. There is also a sticker with a Union Jack flag on it. Mrs Martin said that she is devastated about her car being stolen. To keep her tutoring going her husband now has to drop her off.
