 Manager at Kranspoort, Mr Piet Valks, has confirmed the infection of a female resident. Mr Valks said that he cannot give information on where the resident contracted the virus. He added that the residents have been informed of the infection and have been advised to follow the village’s protocol and refrain from making contact with other residents. “Kranspoort Village falls under the Steve Tshwete Local Municipality, and as it goes with any suburb or residential area, management cannot restrict the movement of residents. Since the implementation of lockdown, management has made the necessary risk analysis, as well as followed strict regulations when it comes to access control of non-residents as well as the use of communal facilities within the village,” Mr Valks told www.mobserver.co.za. The Kranspoort Committee is currently tracing all residents who have been in contact with the infected person.
