 Scores of shoppers were seen queuing at different outlets from as early as 09:00, making sure to stock up after two months of teetotalism. The manager at Kanonkop Spar Tops, Jorge Nunes, confirmed that they celebrated a day of good business on Monday, saying that their delivery service was responsible for most of their sales, after cashing in on 189 deliveries for Monday alone. The business was prepared for their opening, with ample stock, but saw a high demand for gin, leading to a sell-out. “We have received another delivery of stock today and are once again prepared to serve our clients,” Mr Nunes said.

Despite their high level of sales, Mr Vlok assures the public that they are also well stocked with deliveries coming in steadily. Mr Vlok told www.mobserver.co.za that they haven’t experienced a drastic escalation in prices. Liquor outlets experienced a marginal price increase in March, following the annual budget speech and stores then closed under lockdown.
The minimal price increase is in accordance with the new sin tax percentage and is not a result of price hikes during lockdown. Mr Vlok once again reminds customers to do their shopping within the given time allocations, saying that they will not serve customers on Fridays or over weekends. “Lockdown regulations have constrained our business hours from Mondays to Thursdays from 09:00 – 17:00 and we will operate within those regulations,” Mr Vlok said.
