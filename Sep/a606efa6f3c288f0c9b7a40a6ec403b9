Last week, the municipality locked its gates and refused entry to a large crowd of protesters, who handed in a memorandum of demands before dispersing. Before heading to the municipality in a number of minibuses and private vehicles, police dispersed the crowd where they had gathered in Mhluzi, denying them the right to march. On Tuesday a large gathering of protesters assembled again, burning tyres on the Bhimy Damane Street entrance to Mhluzi. In the memorandum, residents demand better employment opportunities for locals at the municipality and flagged several appointments made by the municipality they claim to be “unfair and corrupt”. The community is also up in arms over rates increases they say are “unaffordable”. The group claims that 54 whistle-blowers within the municipality had either been “suspended or laid off,” and their “immediate reinstatement” is called for. Other demands include municipal officials immediately vacating community properties like the Chromeville flats and Hope City, as well as government housing meant for the poor and unemployed. The group has called for an independent review of all outside appointments, like the appointment of two security companies, alongside the tender processes in the awarding of the “questionable contracts”. In a video taken on Tuesday morning ahead of the protests, Mhluzi locals can be seen rallying the community for support. “This is only the beginning,” one of the protesters told www.mobserver.co.za. The gathering is expected to be peaceful and the police are keeping watch.
