He knew rehabilitation from heroin addiction would not be easy, he’s tried and failed seven times before being taken to the Zebulun Lifestyle and Development Centre in Meyerton on Wednesday a fortnight ago. Centre owner, Mr Martin Verster, says Jarod is still going through withdrawal and experienced a “tough day” on Monday.
He asked to be tied to a bed, which Mr Verster refused. Mr Verster says the odd behaviour was just a telltale sign of Jarod craving drugs, which goes hand-in-hand with withdrawal.
Jarod was told to go and sleep it off and after a few hours emerged feeling positive about his journey again. Mr Verster says Jarod is fitting in very well with other residents and Zebulun personnel. “We’re keeping a close eye on him,” Mr Verster said.
