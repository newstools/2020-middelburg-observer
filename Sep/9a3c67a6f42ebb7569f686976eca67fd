He phoned Ms Monica Carstens, who facilitated Jarod’s transport to the Zebulun Lifestyle and Development Centre in Meyerton three weeks ago, this morning with a request to come and fetch him. Jarod is rebelling against authority telling Ms Carstens that he “disliked some things going on here,” in regards to the strict rules and regulations he agreed to during admittance. She refused to go fetch him and pleaded with Jarod to stay. He also phoned his mother in Berlin who pleaded with him to stay, but he was adamant that he was not going to complete the rehabilitation. He then asked whether he could sign himself out, which he regrettably did. Mr Martin Verster of Zebulun says they tried everything to motivate Jarod to stay, “but he’s the author of his own life.” The centre admitted Jarod for free, waiving the almost R100 000 fee it would have cost to get Jarod on track. “I’m sure you will see him back on the streets in a week’s time, it’s sad, but true,” Mr Verster said. His future now rests in the hands of the Middelburg community who will either fuel his drug addiction, or to communally agree to stop giving him money. Jarod does not want to be helped.
