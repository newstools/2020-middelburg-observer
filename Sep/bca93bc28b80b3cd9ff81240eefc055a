Lucinda Ismael says that video footage from the neighbour’s house shows how a man comes, spends some time at their house in Medina Street, before he walks off with the puppy. Ms Ismael says her dog is six weeks old and had a pink collar with a nametag on. She has since received information that the thief is a homeless man who goes by the name Ruff and that her dog was sold to someone in the Nasaret or Hlalamnandi area.  “My biggest fear is thinking of what is going to happen to poor Bella. She is a picky eater who does not like dog pills but ate only chicken rissois that we made for her,” Ms Ismael said. Anyone with information can contact her on 082 758 5606.
