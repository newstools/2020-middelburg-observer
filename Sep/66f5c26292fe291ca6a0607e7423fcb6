Despite pleas to stay put from his mother in Belgium and Ms Monica Carstens, who facilitated his admission to the Zebulun Lifestyle and Development Centre in Meyerton, Jarod decided he had had enough. It was his eighth time in a rehabilitation centre. He was at Zebulun for three weeks before returning to the streets and addiction. He has not returned to Middelburg yet but indicated to Ms Carstens that he would. Zebulun owner Mr Martin Verster said that the past three weeks had been tough on Jarod, but that he fitted in nicely and even asked to be weaned from withdrawal medications. “We can’t force him to stay here,” a disappointed Mr Verster said. The centre offered Jarod treatment for free, waiving the almost R100 000 a year’s stay would have cost him. It’s unclear where Jarod is after he left the centre on foot last Friday morning.
