Traffic figures peaked on Sunday, 27 September, with more than 1 900 vehicles (both directions) passing Middelburg per hour. A major traffic influx was also experienced at Machadodorp with more than 1 500 vehicles (both directions) passing per hour at the local plaza during the early and late afternoon. This was the highest number of vehicles at these plazas recorded this year. Despite TRAC’s best efforts to accommodate the excessive traffic, which included having plazas operating at capacity and having route patrol teams, accident response units and the TRAC Helpdesk on full alert, the elevated traffic volumes affected travel time on the route. The extensive roadworks along the road, especially between Belfast and Machadodorp and near Middelburg, were the main contributors to the congestion. The heaviest delays were experienced at crossroads (the confluence of the Schoemanskloof and Elands Valley) and the area near the Middelburg Toll Plaza. “TRAC would like to apologise to all road users for the inconvenience and thank them for their patience. Although we understand the frustration caused by traffic backlogs, we are pleased to see how eager South Africans are to travel again. “The improvements that are currently under construction along the N4 will ensure an improved travel experience to our road users, once concluded. We are also pleased to report that despite the heavy traffic along the route, only three accidents were recorded yesterday, with no serious injuries or fatalities recorded.”
