Police are still on the scene combing the mall and surrounds for the robbers. According to an eyewitness, a group of men entered the mall where they ambushed cash in transit guards on their way to Shoprite to drop off cash.
The robbers wrestled the cash boxes from the transit guards and ran into Shoprite. The transit guards immediately closed the doors trapping shoppers and staff inside with the robbers. The robbers however succeeded in fleeing from a back staff door.
The shop uses a bio-metric admission system for staff. It is believed that a staff member was forced to open up the back door for the robbers. They fled on foot to the nearby Sasol garage where police believe a getaway vehicle awaited them. Forensic specialists have been called to the scene where shops remain closed. The public is advised to avoid the mall until investigations are complete. Dog handlers were also dispatched to pick up the trail of the robbers. No one was injured.
