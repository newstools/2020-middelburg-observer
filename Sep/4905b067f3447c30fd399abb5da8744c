The tower 520 is located near Tonga just outside Nelspruit, and close to the border between South Africa and Mozambique. The Arnot-Maputo 400kV Line is a crucial cross-border power line running from Arnot Power Station to Maputo. This line feeds Mozal Aluminium smelter which is the backbone of Mozambique’s economy. As can be seen from the photographs, the sand has been excavated deeply around the base of the stay wire of this tower – hence the emergency declaration, because the tower could imminently collapse if the foundation is subjected to moderate storm or the tower is subjected to windy conditions.  If this suspension tower collapses it will take down a few more towers (cascade effect because it is not a strain tower) and trip the Arnot-Maputo 400 kV line. Over and above the impact on the Mozal smelter, in Mozambique, this collapsed line will be an extreme hazard to people, animals and vehicles in the surrounding area. To replace a collapsed tower today costs more than R3 million, this amount is substantial enough to electrify 75 homes. “We appeal to the surrounding communities to be conscious of the impact of damaging activities close to power lines, and we encourage them to report any unusual activity near towers to the local police station so Eskom can get the perpetrators behind bars, or call Eskom on 08600 37566,” says Miranda Moahlodi, Senior Manager for Occupational Health and Safety at Eskom. Eskom will be visiting nearby communities this week to educate them about the dangers and impacts that results from sand mining near high voltage power lines. Emergency preparation work to stabilise the stay wire anchor will start immediately.
