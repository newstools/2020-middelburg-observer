Staffers were busy cleaning the restaurant and kitchen when the robbers pounced. According to one of the victims, two men entered the outlet arousing immediate suspicion. The victim ran to the kitchen to alert two other colleagues, who were already being held up at gunpoint by two other robbers.
The three staffers were instructed to lie face down before they were searched. One of the robbers stole the employees’ cell phones while the manager was forced to unlock the safe.
With the night’s earnings and cell phones in hand, the robbers fled without hurting anyone. The employees only rose from the ground after the SAPS showed up on the scene. While the SAPS was combing the restaurant for clues, they found a bound security guard at the back of the outlet. The combined value of the cash and phones stolen, is estimated at R28 136.
