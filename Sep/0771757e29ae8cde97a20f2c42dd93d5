The Middelburg Observer has previously reported about a local resident, who lives in Bankenveld in eMalahleni but attends the mosque in Middelburg, who sometimes uses the helicopter to commute between the two locations. The pilot of the aircraft, who previously spoke to the Middelburg Observer on condition of anonymity, said the Civil Aviation Authority has granted permission for the helicopter to land in the open field opposite the mosque next to Koets Street.
