Mr Cornelius (48) was found guilty and sentenced to pay R10 000, or three years imprisonment, as well as a fine of R50 000 to be paid to Mpumalanga Parks Board. On January 4, 2018, information was followed up by members of the Hawks about a suspect from Gauteng who was negotiating the sale of rhino horn with Mr Cornelius, without the necessary permits. The intelligence-driven operation was conducted by members of the Hawks and the SAPS K9 unit. In the early hours of January 5, 2018, the Gauteng suspect arrived at Ubhetyan-o-Africa with a white Lexus, which was stopped and searched.
During the search, a white rhino horn was found attached to the chassis of the vehicle with cable ties.  The horn, valued at R175 000, was found with R699 129 in cash. Chinese nationals Yansen Feng and Lui Li Hong were arrested on the spot. On January 12, 2018, continued investigations led to the arrest of co-accused Joseph Albertus du Plessis and Susanna Johanna du Plessis in Bloemfontein.

The cases against Cornelius’s four co-accused was finalized in 2018.
