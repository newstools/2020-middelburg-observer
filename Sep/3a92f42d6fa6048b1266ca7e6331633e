Entries for the science expo, in collaboration with the Department of Education, will close on December 3, 2020.
Learners can find all the information they need and enter online at www.exposcience.co.za. Learners have 13 categories to chose from, including energy, physics, astronomy, agricultural sciences and biomedical sciences. Due to the expo taking place online, budding scientists should only enter a written abstract project alongside a research plan.
If selected, Eskom Expo for Young Scientists will contact the winners and assist with the development of models, which will be entered into international competitions. All entrants will receive a medal and certificate. Winners can look forward to laptops, bursaries and even international travel. Schools also stand a chance to win fully equipped science laboratories. For more information and guidance, prospective entrants can contact Mr Innocent Marume by WhatsApp on 073 305 9698.
