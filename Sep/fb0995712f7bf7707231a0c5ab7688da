Mr Ivan Japal said they heard the cat in Weeber Street (Eastdene), but did not know where it was. Yesterday they saw the cat in the palm tree and contacted the Middelburg Fire Brigade, but they were told that they will have to pay for a rescue mission. “It is a stray cat and I did not want to pay for a cat that is not even our pet.” Earlier today Mr Japal saw that the cat is still in the tree and asked the Middelburg SPCA for help. “They responded immediately!” On their way to the house, the SPCA saw workers from the municipality who worked with a Cherry Picker and asked them for help. Senior Inspector Petro Oberholzer, and Mr Japal stood underneath the tree with a duvet while Mr Jonas Lubisi (SPCA Kennel Supervisor) went up with the person from the municipality in the Cherry Picker to rescue the cat. Mr Lubisi grabbed the cat, which was still clutching to the tree, with the cat grabber, and they were safely taken to the ground. • Mr Japal would like to thank the SPCA and everybody else who helped with the rescue.
