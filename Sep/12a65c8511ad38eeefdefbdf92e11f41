Protesters have blocked the Vandyksdrift Road, just after the N4 offramp. Taxis and other vehicles have been blocking the road since early this morning, refusing other vehicles to pass. On Call for Life alerted motorists via WhatsApp to avoid the route entirely, and taking alternative routes. Traffic is presently backed up towards the N4 turnoff. Police have not responded to calls for comment fromÂ www.mobserver.co.za.
