The announcement was made with the airing of a documentary commissioned to commemorate the vital role journalists play in our society – especially in light of the harsh circumstances journalists as individuals find themselves in during the coronavirus pandemic. The documentary, which was filmed in recent months while the country remained under national lockdown regulations, shone a light on the courageous work done by South African journalists on the frontline in a time of great unease and continued stress, due to the global pandemic. Middelburg Observer journalists were also at the forefront of the battle, sharing vital information to our community during the last few months. To honour their work, well-known artist Annelie Hertzog surprised them with a face painting on Tuesday. •The Nat Nakasa Award is awarded annually by Print Media SA, the South African National Editors’ Forum and the Nieman Society in recognition of any media practitioner – journalist, editor, manager or owner – who has: Shown integrity and reported fearlessly Displayed a commitment to serve the people of South Africa Tenaciously striven to maintain a publication or other medium despite insurmountable obstacles Resisted any censorship Shown courage in making information available to the South African public.
