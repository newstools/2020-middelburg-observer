The objective of this meeting is: • To get to understand how each NPO distributes food • Discuss the use of the database again (for those who want to use it). • Identify loop holes. • How all the NPO’s can make a difference to the levels of poverty experienced at the moment (each NPO in its own without compromising the amazing work already done). The organisers said that NPO’s who are listed, are welcome to bring any other NPO’s along.
