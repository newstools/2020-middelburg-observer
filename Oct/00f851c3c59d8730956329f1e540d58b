Www.mobserver.co.za received a photo of Jarod begging at a corner at the Eastrand Mall during the weekend. Jarod returned to the streets after he signed himself out of the Zebulun Lifestyle Development Centre, where he was receiving free rehabilitation for heroin addiction. He only stayed in the centre for nine days before leaving. Jarod would have received a year-long free treatment from the centre.
The value of the treatment is just short of R100 000. He also received a number of donations, like clothes, blankets, food and R1000 cash, from local Samaritans before he departed for the centre. Jarod ignored pleas from his mother and grandmother to remain at the centre. Also read: Jarod O’Connor signs himself out of rehab to return to the streets He signed himself out of the rehabilitation centre, telling Ms Monica Carstens who facilitated a ride for Jarod to Meyerton, that he was “averse to what was happening at the clinic”. Owner Mr Martin Verster told www.mobserver.co.za that the centre could not force Jarod to stay. Middelburg residents have wondered what had happened to Jarod after he failed to return to Middelburg’s streets. Ms Carstens, who had regular contact with Jarod, says she’s also not heard from him since he signed himself out of the centre on September 12. During the last conversation Ms Carstens had with Jarod, he told her that he walked over 60km to the Eastrand from Meyerton. Jarod still uses his trademark gimmick, by kneeling and praying, to grab the public’s attention.
