Patients lining up for medical attention were appalled at the service received from nursing staff, due to a private memorial service being conducted from within the medical facility. Queueing patients explained that the memorial service which nurses were attending, had left only one staff member on duty, and that the nurse was calling in three patients at a time as she battled through the workload. One sick resident who had been queueing since 07:00 this morning, was helped by other patients after his condition rapidly deteriorated and blood came spewing from his nose. The man was crippled by abdominal pain, and other patients in line rushed him into the clinic building for assistance. The man was seen to by a nurse who administered medication, and on his way out, he collapsed at the entrance of the clinic. Patients rushed to his aid once again, placing him in a wheelchair. Nokuthula Motau, the deceased’s sister, explained that she was at work when her mother called, informing her that her brother is doing badly. When she rushed to the clinic, she found him cringing with pain and blood running down his face. She explained that the nurse “just stood there”, and that she eventually grabbed some water to clean his bloodied face and calm him down. Her brother, Sibusiso Zulu, died before her eyes. Members of the Mhluzi SAPS were calming down the crowds, who angrily spoke out against the service conditions. One patient stated that the entrance to the clinic should have ambulances driving through, and not the Everest Funeral Services. “It is unacceptable! Our children and women stand for hours in the blistering sun and rain. They don’t even attend to our elders. This is a clinic, not a burial parlour or a church!” The Department of Health has been contacted and www.mobserver.co.za awaits their response.
