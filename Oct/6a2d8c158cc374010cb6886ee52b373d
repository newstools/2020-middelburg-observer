The collision occurred shortly after 19:00 at the Dr Beyers Naude Street and Nelson Mandela Drive crossing in Mhluzi. A part of Dr Beyers Naude Street was closed for traffic in order for the scene to be cleared. The car and taxi collided head-on. Five ambulances had to be dispatched to ferry the injured to hospital. One of the local ambulance services withdrew from the scene shortly after arrival, when members of the public demanded that the paramedics first treat one of the drivers involved. Paramedics, however, insisted on treating more seriously injured passengers first. The crowd became increasingly angered and paramedics decided to withdraw from the scene, for their own safety. Luckily, no one was fatally injured.
