Jarod signed himself out of the centre three weeks ago despite pleas from his mother and grandmother to stay put. Jarod agreed to go to the centre a month ago after dishing up excuses, like a court appearance for shoplifting, in an attempt to avoid the clinic.
He finally gave in after Ms Monica Carstens organised transport for him to Meyerton. In rehab Jarod had his ups and downs, but it went so well he even asked to be weened from medication for withdrawal.
He spent nine nights inside the rehabilitation centre before signing himself out. He walked to Benoni where, after a few days back on the streets, he contacted Ms Carstens with the news that he wanted to return to the centre. Centre owner Mr Martin Verster welcomed Jarod back on the condition that he returned the way he left, by himself.
That was the last time anyone heard from Jarod. “I’m worried that something may have happened to him because he’s vulnerable and alone,” Ms Carstens told www.mobserver.co.za on Tuesday.
Jarod regularly contacted her from other people’s phones but has now gone completely mute. “I thought he would have been back at the centre, or at least back in Middelburg by now, but there’s no news,” Ms Carstens says. Mr Verster also confirmed that he’s not had any contact with Jarod.
