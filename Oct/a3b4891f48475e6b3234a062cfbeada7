An emotional Patricia Smit told the www.mobserver.co.za that officials at the department refused to assist her. Ms. Smit said she went to the department on Tuesday, she was the last person in the office, they told her to return the following day. When she arrived the next day at 06:45, she found people filling their names in on a list.
She claims the manager told the other residents not to give her the list. She went home after she was asked to go back at the end of the queue. www.mobserver.co.za spoke to residents who stood in the long queues for at least 12 hours. The provincial spokesperson of the department, Joe Maswanganyi, said the department is currently not aware of the matter however he will respond once the department has investigated.
