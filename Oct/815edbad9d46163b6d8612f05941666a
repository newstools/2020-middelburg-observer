Ms. Precious Manqele (27), was held by two armed men in balaclavas, in the household she works for in Sekhukhune Street, Aerorand on 6 October. Precious was threatened with a knife against her throat as well as at gunpoint, as her attackers repeatedly interrogated her over the location of a safe. Despite being instructed to keep quiet, her anxious screams soon had the suspects fleeing the scene without their loot, enabling her of locking herself away in one of the rooms and calling her employer. Her employer, Ms. Annabel Deysel, immediately summoned the help of the Community Policing Forum, and a shaken Precious was found with torn clothes and an injured knee. The speedy response of the CPF soon had the dense bush surrounding the Kruger Dam area crawling with members of the SAPS, CPF, Hawk Security, Mid Alarms, the Sector 3 Emergency Radio Group and CSC Tactical. A stun grenade was detonated and the bush was fine-combed for the suspects, which led to the discovery of a shack full of stolen property and electronics. During the search, another emergency call was received from a homestead in Soutpansberg Street, after residents managed to apprehend an intruder on their property. The intruder was handed over to the police. •See original articles written by Daleen Naudé in a copy of the Middelburg Observer, 9 October 2020.
