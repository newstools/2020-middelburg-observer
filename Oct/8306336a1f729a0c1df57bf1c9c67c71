The video, which www.mobserver.co.za obtained from an anonymous source, shows how the murderer walks straight to his target and starts to stab him, he passed away on the scene. Okoi (38) was sitting at Diamond Lounge, a tavern in the Central Business District, watching soccer on his phone when he was attacked from behind. At one stage Okoi seems to be gaining the upper hand, pinning his attacker to the ground. A source told www.mobserver.co.za, that in the process of pinning his attacker to the ground, he simply proceeded to stab Okoi in the chest. The rest of the people at the establishment seem oblivious to what is happening. One man can be seen lifting his hands in the air whilst another man gets involved in the brawl between Okoi and his attacker at one stage.

At the police station they were chased away, ignoring claims from the group that he was involved in a stabbing. The man was later allowed to leave the police station after the group of men that were after him were dispersed. Middelburg police spokesperson, Capt. Khanyisile Zwane, said that the man was protected because the police will never allow an attack on someone to happen in front of their eyes. She said that at the time when the man was released, he was not connected to any crime. Shortly thereafter www.mobserver.co.za received news that a man was arrested on Thursday afternoon. He is expected to appear in the Middelburg Magistrate Court today (Friday). Watch the video by visiting the following link: https://fb.watch/1rB7BXXzcr/
