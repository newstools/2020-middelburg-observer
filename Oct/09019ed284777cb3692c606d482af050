Isaac, who works at Remax Properties, said that he and his manager went into the office to get some paperwork out of the way when the incident took place. The real estate company doesnâ€™t usually work on Saturdays and Isaac explained that they did not lock the gate to the property, because they never expected any walk in clients. His manager quickly popped out to the pharmacy when a man came in looking for piece work. Isaac explained to him that there were no vacancies and the man then left, only to return a few minutes later armed with a pair of scissors.
The man turned hostile and tried to stab Isaac, who managed to duck away from the attack. He demanded that Isaac place two laptops, an Ipad as well as some of his cash and documents, including his passport and drivers license, into a bag. Isaac considered apprehending the man, but was fearful that another suspect was hiding on the property because he could hear him communicating with someone outside. The video footage captured by CCTV footage showed that the suspect was alone. A case was opened at the Middelburg SAPS and photos of the suspect was circulated on security WhatsApp groups.
Isaac was fortunate to escape the robbery without any physical harm.
