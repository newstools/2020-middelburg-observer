Following relentless complaints from residents, an investigation has unearthed the manhole, which has been gushing out raw sewerage for days on end. Eastdene residents called www.mobserver.co.za to explain that the Vaalbank stream that passes through their community, at the low-water bridge in Koets Street, has been so polluted that the odour is unbearable. These complaints follow on yet more reports from a local fisherman, who led a journalist to the Klein Olifants River where it passes under the Meyer Street Bridge. Mr Flippie de Bruyn, who remembers a time when the river was fit enough to frolic in as children, says the water has become so hazardous that fish are dying in the multitudes.

While water from both the Vaalbank stream and Klein Olifants make their way to the Loskop Dam, a catastrophic sewer leak in eMalahleni, which is slowly strangling the life out of the Olifants River, also flows into the nature reserve, finally making its way into the irrigation canals used by Loskop farmers. • The gushing sewer line in Zuid Street has been investigated and reported to the Steve Tshwete Local Municipality by DA Ward Councillor, Jos Pretorius. Cllr Pretorius told www.mobserver.co.za that an inspection has found that the sewer line’s drainage system is inadequate, “STLM will have to take a look at the whole system and additional drainage pipes should be installed.” Watch video footage of the leaking sewer line by clicking on the link: https://fb.watch/1p43Pa7SLH/
