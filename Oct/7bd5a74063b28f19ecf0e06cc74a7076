On Wednesday, a notification was sent out by the municipality urging residents to remove their waste from the curbside until further notice. According to the municipal spokesperson, Ms Prudence Magutle, the entire department had to attend a Covid-19 labour consultation, which took the entire day. “The department is still in negotiations with the municipality about safety measures to ensure the protection of solid waste removal staff,” a widely circulated WhatsApp message read early Friday. This is not true. “Labour consultations with the department did take place and was resolved,” Ms Magutle said. “We apologise for the inconvenience, but personnel and public safety is paramount in the resurgence of Covid-19 infections, the backlog will be addressed today” Ms Magutle said. “Only areas scheduled for Wednesday collections were affected,” Ms Magutle says. Residents in the affected areas should put out their trash for collection today (Friday). Affected areas include Kanonkop, Dennesig and Gholfsig.
