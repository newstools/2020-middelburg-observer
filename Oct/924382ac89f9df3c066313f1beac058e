The two boys lost their lives when the fire broke out in their home on Friday evening. A still shaken Xolani Zimo told www.mobserver.co.za on Monday that he realised that the house was on fire at 10:30.
Mr Zimo said the whole family was sleeping when the fire broke out in one of the bedrooms. It is understood that a candle started the fire. Family members managed to rescue three children who were trapped in the house. Olwethu Zimo (2) and Wandile Mogola, died while the family was trying to douse the flames. “The flames were to strong and the smoke was thick I could not enter the room to save them. I heard Olwethu crying but I could not get to him,” said the distressed Mr Zimo. The children shared the home with nine other family members who lost all their belongings in the blaze. Residents are urged to make donations to the Zimo family, for more information contact Phindile Nkonyane on 067 943 8650.
