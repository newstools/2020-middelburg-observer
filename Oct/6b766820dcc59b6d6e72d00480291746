The duo, Sizwe Khaba (36) and Rhison Makhamba (42), had already received hefty jail time sentences of eight years imprisonment each for railway infrastructure damage and the contravention of the Immigration Act by the Middelburg Regional Court, four weeks ago. Khaba received a further two years on top of the eight-year sentence, for being in the country illegally. In November 2018, the Hawks received information about active railway thefts around Middelburg, Stoffberg and Laersdrift. Both Khaba and Makhamba were caught red-handed by the Serious Organised Crime Division, crime intelligence, Vispol, Transnet Security and Afriguard members during a sting. They were connected to another case and a trial date was set for this week. The Regional Court, however, withdrew charges against the duo on Monday.
