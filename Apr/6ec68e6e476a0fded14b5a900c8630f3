 Field workers started screening in Mhluzi, Doornkop and Kwazamokuhle on Wednesday morning. Lakeview Manor’s 52 residential units were also visited for screening on Wednesday, while 90 homes at Vergeet My Nie retirement village were visited on Thursday.
A screening programme for the rest of the town, like Kanonkop, Dennesig and the CBD, has not been released. Four teams are conducting door-to-door screenings, while gazebos will be erected at central points, like the one at the Midwater Centre on Tuesday, to target shoppers in an attempt to cast the net wider due to slow progress. Presently the four teams have visited around twenty homes per day since last week Thursday, averaging 80 to 100 homes daily, including over the weekend.
During Aerorand’s screening, no Covid-19 cases were detected and no tests have been done. Due to the low infections, swabs will not be taken during the door-to-door campaign, and possible infections will be referred to local clinics for testing.
