Dr Welsh shared the following basics on the virus: • The hospitals won’t be able to handle the pandemic if residents flout the lockdown regulations. • Masks are in short supply and won’t protect you from infection. Infected residents should, however, wear them to avoid spreading the infection. • Always maintain a two-metre social distance from others. • Gloves, especially re-worn gloves, are unhygienic. Rather wash your hands regularly. • Residents must also keep in mind that doctors must continue to treat other illnesses and emergencies. • “Stay at home!” Dr Welsh says.
