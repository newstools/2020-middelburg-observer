 The only known case related to Middelburg was that of a woman who resides in Gauteng but stayed in Middelburg during the week for work in eMalahleni. She returned to Gauteng after she tested positive in eMalahleni. It is unclear whether the one Covid-19 case listed under Middelburg is that of the woman mentioned above. Several rumours have once again surfaced of people being admitted to both Life Midmed and the Middelburg Hosptial for Covid-19. It could be confirmed, via several sources, that two Covid-19 positive people residing in Dullstroom recently travelled to the Middelburg Hospital for their 14 day swab (a follow up test two weeks after testing positive). They were not admitted to hospital and only visited the premises for testing. According to sources no person has been admitted to either Midmed or the Middelburg Hosptial because of Covid-19. Both hospitals have prepared isolation wards should it become necessary to treat patients infected with the virus.
