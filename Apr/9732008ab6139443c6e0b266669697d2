 A charitable food-run went south on Sunday after a group of bikers from the Wheels In The Sky Middelburg chapter took to the N11 to hand out food parcels. Adriaan Windell, husband and father of two, lost control of his motorcycle and violently struck a tree, causing fractures in both his legs, arms and ribs, a dislocation of his hip and severe head trauma. Club President Michael Longuiero, who has been acting as a spokesperson for the Windell family, told www.mobserver.co.za earlier this week that Adriaan was admitted to the Witbank Provincial Hospital where he is currently lying in critical condition. Windell’s wife Maraai cannot visit Adriaan due to lockdown regulations. The Wheels In The Sky biking community have gone down on their knees in support for the family, asking for prayers and financial support. Mr Longuiero says the club has managed to raise some funds for Adriaan’s medical expenses that so far have covered the costs of two pints of blood, a CT scan and a neurologist to assess Adriaan. Anyone who wishes to donate to the Windell family can contact Michael Longuiero on 078 322 0853.
