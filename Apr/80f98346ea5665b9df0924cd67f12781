 According to provincial health spokesman Mr Dumisane Malamule testing have been rolled out province wide, including in Middelburg.
The screening will include Covid-19 swabs to be taken for testing at mobile testing stations in each district. Mr Malamule told www.mobserver.co.za that home to home tests starts from Thursday. He couldn’t confirm the number of field testers in the field, or how many mobile laboratories have been designated to the Nkangala District.
Temperature screenings have already been implemented at all road blocks at the exits of town. Botshabelo has been identified as Middelburg’s quarantine area. Police members will be accompanying field testers to the respective areas for home to home testing.
The testing procedure is non invasive, with only swabs taken with throat and nose samples. No needles are involved, Mr Malamule confirmed. He said field workers will be clearly identified, and will be chaperoned by police or other law enforcement officials.
He urged residents not to panic.
