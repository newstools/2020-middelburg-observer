 The Nkangala ANC welcomed the suspension and arrest of Steve Tshwete municipal councillor, Mr Musawenkosi Masina, for allegedly issuing fraudulent essential services work permits at R300 per permit. Www.mobserver.co.za reliably learnt that the Steve Tshwete ANC caucus is also investigating another councillor in its midst for the same offence. The second investigation is, however, still ongoing. According to a report submitted to the ANC in regards to Mr Masina’s suspension, a council delegation visited Hendrina  with law enforcement officials for a national lockdown inspection on Thursday. During a walk trough inspection, a shop owner in Hendrina produced the fraudulent essential services permit, allegedly issued by Mr Masina. Further investigation revealed that Mr Masina allegedly charged R300 per permit. Mr Masina was arrested but released on warning. He was rearrested on Friday after allegedly selling fraudulent permits again. He will appear in court next week. The EFF’s Mr Enos Sebesho says the suspension is not enough and that the ANC ought to remove Mr Masina from council permanently. “If the allegation that he was caught, released and rearrested, its clear that he has no respect for the rule of law, and actively putting lives in danger unnecessarily,” Mr Sebesho told www.mobserver.co.za. A media briefing on the scandal is scheduled to be held tomorrow. The DA commended the swift action taken by the ANC.
