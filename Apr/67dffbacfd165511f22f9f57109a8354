 Detained ANC councillor, Mr Musawenkosi Masina, arrested for allegedly issuing fraudulent essential services permits to a number of businesses in Hendrina will appear in court next week, and apart from the criminal charges he’s facing, he has also been suspended from council where he will also face the ethics committee after lockdown. Executive Mayor, Cllr Bagudi Tolo, and Steve Tshwete Council Speaker Cllr Andries Mabena, just concluded a Sunday press conference in the mayor’s boardroom, addressing Mr Masin’s arrest and detention at the Hendrina police holding cells where Speaker Mabena served him with his suspension papers on Saturday. The matter has also been referred to council’s ethics committee for consideration. The fraudulent work permits allegedly issued by Mr Masina was discovered during a joint operation between the municipality, SAPS and SANDF in Hendrina on Thursday, where it was produced by a local retailer. Mayor Tolo confirmed that a number of other businesses were also closed after discovering similar permits allegedly issued by Mr Masina. He was released but rearrested on Friday when statements of him receiving alleged “gratuity  payments” in return for the permits were made to police. Mayor Tolo denied knowledge of other ANC councillors being investigated for similar offences. Mayor Tolo defended council’s decision as “responsible” saying that the message should be clear that no form of corruption will be condoned. “The law must run its course,” mayor Tolo said, adding that the allegations amounted to a breach of oath.
