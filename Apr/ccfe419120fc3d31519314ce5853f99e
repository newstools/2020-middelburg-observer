 During his address to the nation last Thursday, President Cyril Ramaphosa said everyone was called on to wear a face mask.
Kanonkop Spar is one of the grocery stores that is taking the president’s call seriously. When www.mobserver.co.za visited the store it found employees wearing latex gloves and face shields. As the country enters Stage 4 of the lockdown, residents are encouraged to wear masks whenever they leave their homes and practice social distancing. A voice note is making rounds on social media sites claiming residents in Middelburg will not be permitted to enter the Middelburg Mall without a face mask, it further said children will also not be allowed at the mall. Middelburg Mall Manager, Mike Tammadge, said the voice note is fake news. He said residents will not be prohibited from doing their shopping at the mall without wearing a mask. He added that the mall will wait for instructions from the South African Police Service and The Department of Health before implementing changes. Middelburg Police Spokesperson Capt. Khanyisile Zwane said the police have to wait for directives from the Disaster Management Act Gazette before they can start enforcing a regulation.
