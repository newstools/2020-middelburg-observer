 Jean Coetzee, manager at OK Foods Mineralia, explained that the post came after a group of policemen visited the store on Tuesday afternoon, threatening to close it down if they see people inside without masks, and also telling people waiting in line that they will be fined when caught without a mask again. Mr Coetzee says that they have since removed the post. He says that he is caught between a rock and a hard place because he cannot ignore instructions by the police, even though he might not agree with them, because he cannot afford his store to be closed down. Capt. Khanyisile Zwane, Middelburg Police spokesperson, said that no law declaring the wearing of masks compulsory has been gazetted. “We are dealing with compliance and we are using the gazette to determine what that is. The minister advised that everyone wear cloth masks but I have not seen such a law. Until it appears in the gazette, it is not a law, only a recommendation,” Capt. Zwane said. She advised that members of the public who are confronted by police officers about wearing masks should get their names and vehicle registration numbers to help follow up such incidents. • It was initially advised that only sick people or persons taking care of sick people should wear masks. On Friday, 10 April, Minister of Health Dr Zweli Mkhize said that everyone should be wearing a mask. He said that even cloth masks are effective as long as there are three layers and asked for specialised masks to be reserved for medial personnel dealing with Covid-19 patients. • A man caused a stir by wearing a welding mask at Clicks in the Middelburg Central Business District.
