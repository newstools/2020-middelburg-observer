 Municipal Manager, Mr Bheki Khenisa, said the municipality will meet with the department on Wednesday for a schedule on home testing by departmental staff. During a meeting on Monday it was also decided to issue ward councillors with essential services permits.
They will now be allowed to distribute necessary information by moving around in their wards. Mr Khenisa says the permits were only issued to ward councillors and proportional representatives. “We are awaiting a schedule for home testing which will kick off in Middelburg this week,” Mr Khenisa confirmed. President Cyril Ramaphosa last Monday announced the deployment of 10 000 field workers to conduct the countrywide home to home testing. “We are still awaiting a schedule from the department and notifications on what areas will be targeted,” Mr Khenisa says. South Africa has been commended for President Ramaphosa’s bold approach by implementing a 21 day countrywide shutdown amid the spread of the virus.
The field testing will result in around 30 000 to 40 000 daily tests.
