 Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, provincial police spokesperson, said the arrests followed an incident on 12 March when a man, transporting children to school on the back of his bakkie, was pulled over. His drivers licence was allegedly confiscated and money was demanded for its return. The driver did not have any money and arrangements were made to pay the bribe at the end of the month. The police were contacted shortly after the money was paid at the end of March, leading to the arrests of the six traffic officials, who were aged between 28 and 43. The money mentioned was allegedly still found in their possession. The accused appeared in the Middelburg Magistrateâ€™s Court on 2 April, facing charges of corruption and defeating the administration of justice. They have been released on warning and will appear again in court on 8 April. Brig. Hlathi said the public can report corrupt activities by calling 086 00 10111 or by sending an SMS to 32211.
