The SAPS, SANDF, traffic officials and Mayor Bagudi Tolo, were actively patrolling the streets of Mhluzi this morning. While addressing law enforcement officials, Mayor Tolo expressed his disappointment with residents that have been ignoring lockdown regulations.  Traffic officers stopped motorists to ascertain whether they had valid reasons for being on the road.
Those who were roaming the streets for no reason were immediately sent back home.  The officers will spend the day patrolling Mhluzi and other surrounding areas. Brigadier Moses Bolton encouraged SAPS members to arrest those found selling alcohol and cigarettes.
