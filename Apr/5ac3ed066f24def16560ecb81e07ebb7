 Since this past weekend 51 people were arrested:  Residents are warned that they will be arrested for driving any vehicle with more than three occupants. “Only three people are allowed inside cars, no more,” Captain Khanyesile Zwane warned. She said parents driving around with the excuse of buying their children snacks, will also not be tolerated. “Sweets and chips and sherbet and alien sour spray is not essential,” Captain Zwane warns. Captain Zwane also has a stern warning for CPF members driving around with CPF stickers and magnets, and colored lights on their vehicles. “No CPF activities are allowed, CPF members driving around with CPF stickers or magnets as well as colored lights on their cars must remove them immediately until the lockdown is lifted, they do not have special privileges, the police will act against any CPF member who fails to comply with the order,” Captain Zwane said.
