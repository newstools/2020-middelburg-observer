The accident followed on an armed robbery that took place at Mias Wholesale late this afternoon. Messages soon circulated that Mias was robbed at gunpoint, and that the tyres of a vehicle on the premises was shot to aid in their get-away. They then fled in a red vehicle as well as a white Hyundai one-ton truck, which was also stolen not far from where the robbery took place. The owner of Mias Wholesale pursued the robbers and managed to force the Hyundai truck to a stop, where one suspect was apprehended, and two others fled on foot. No serious injuries were sustained during the robbery, or the accident and the red vehicle involved in the robbery managed to get away.
