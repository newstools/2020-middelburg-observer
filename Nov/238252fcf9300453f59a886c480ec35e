If there’s one municipal department residents can trust on outside internal labour disputes, it is the solid waste department. At 06:00 on Wednesday the team was out in Kanonkop collecting garbage with adapted compactor trucks which lifts and empties the wheelie bins before releasing them. If the bin isn’t entirely emptied at the first lift, it repeats the process before compaction. Residents must ensure that their bin are out at 06:00 on their respective collection days. The bins must be clearly marked with the street name and number. The municipal logo must be visible at all times. Only green wheelie bins will be emptied. Residents can further assist the collectors by dividing the refuse in recyclables which will be sorted at the new sorting plant under construction at the landfill site.
