An intelligence-driven investigation led to the arrest of two suspects aged between 28 and 41 on Wednesday, 25 November for fraud and money laundering. It is alleged that the victims saw an advertisement for employment and they applied by sending their Curriculum Vitae as required. The victims were called and informed that they were hired and had to send money for cold drink to the bank account numbers given to them. They were ordered to pay a sum of R500 to R3 500 per person to ensure that they skip the selection process and are guaranteed immediate employment. Deposits were made but the suspects started ignoring their calls. They tried all means to locate them without a success until they decided to report the matter to the police. The investigation was handed over to the Hawks who used intelligence to investigate and arrest the suspects. The two suspects, a male and a female are detained and expected to appear before the Middelburg Magistrateâ€™s Court on Thursday 26 November.
