Kanonkop Spar manager, Mr. Jorge Nunes, confirmed that his store will be selling electricity tokens as of 16 November. This comes as good news for Dennesig and Kanonkop residents in particular, who will no longer have to dare on the central areas of town to top up on their units. Mr. Nunes said that Kanonkop Spar is excited to be offering an extra service to their loyal customers, making their shopping experience even more convenient than it already is.
