This special event is in aid of the Middelburg Hospice Association. The word “Hospice” is derived from the Latin word “Hospes”, which means to reach out to those who are suffering. Hospice does, amongst others: • Professional pain and symptoms management for terminally ill patients. • Hospi- home care service by volunteers and registered nurses. • Advisory nursing. • Death guidance and counselling. There are only 250 places (R150 adults, R50 children) available for the “Shine Bright for Hospice” event. If you can not go to the event, but still want to make a donation, it can also help. The Covid-19 pandemic touched and shook us all. Hospice urgently needs our help. To book your place or to make a donation, call Simony at 071 401 3004 or Rico at 083 396 7091.
