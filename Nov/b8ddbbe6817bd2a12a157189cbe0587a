The combined work of Reaction Officers Ferdie Labuschagne, Louis Zietsman, Rogers Mishave and Ruan Cloete, led to the apprehension of a man who stole steel wall decorations and house numbers in Wassenaar Street. The team managed to track the suspect down in Totius Street, where he fled in Mhluzi’s direction. The suspect was finally caught and handed over to the police, and his loot was confiscated from his person. This arrest follows on another incident that took place in Eastdene. CSC Tactical also captured the man who viciously stabbed a man and woman, who were fishing by the river behind Eastdene’s Sport Complex.
