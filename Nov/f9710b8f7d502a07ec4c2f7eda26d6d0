For over a week and a half, the Vaalbank stream and Klein Olifants river has been visibly rotting from the ceaseless pollution of raw sewerage and other harmful waste.  Within a week, www.mobserver.co.za has published four different articles on the pollution.

A day later, an Eastdene resident shared video footage and photos, showing the Vaalbank stream’s once clear waters, converting into a white sludge. Www.mobserver.co.za contacted DA Ward Councillor, Johann Dyason, who had just returned from his own inspection of the stream under the accompaniment of the Director of Infrastructure, April Ntuli and MMC Johan Matshiane. Cllr. Dyason explained that their inspection included local businesses in the industrial area, where it was found that oil and paint was being illegally dumped into the sewer-lines, resulting in the blockage of the drainage systems.

Dyason explained that after a three month long battle against the continual pollution, has now pushed him into directing a written inquiry at STLM, which will be addressed on the agenda at the next council sitting. “It is time for a door-to-door inspection of each of these companies in the industrial area, which might be potentially dumping hazardous chemicals like oil and paint into the sewer systems. These companies need to be named and brought to book.” While the battle continues to find a final solution to the problem, one Eastdene resident has given up hope on the municipality, and has decided to escalate the matter to the Green Scorpions.
