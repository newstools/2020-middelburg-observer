While residents prepared for a third ban on alcohol and cigarettes, the liquor industry is pleased to know that it’s business as usual. According to a local retailer, normal business hours will resume with immediate effect. Local liquor retailers are of the opinion that the extension on business hours will hopefully lessen the impact of drunken driving or substance-induced incidents. One retailer, who chose to remain anonymous, attributed the increase of alcohol induced accidents to restrained hours, saying that limited access to alcohol drove consumers to visiting local pubs after running out of stock. “Extended hours will now make it easier for consumers to purchase their own alcohol and consume from the comfort of their own homes. Consumers visiting pubs results in intoxicated consumers driving or walking home at late hours.” General trading hours, depending on the proprietor, is as follows:
Mondays to Saturdays: 09:00 – 20:00 or 8:00 to 20:00
Sundays and public holidays: 10:00 – 17:00. The trading hours for bars and taverns will also be extended, allowing enterprises to operate until 02:00 in the mornings.
