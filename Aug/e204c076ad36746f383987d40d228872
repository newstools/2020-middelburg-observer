Two trucks were involved in a horrible collision in the Kranspoort Pass on Friday night. The pass was closed after the collision and traffic is still backed up. A single lane will be opened for traffic soon. One person was killed. An eyewitness said they had to flee the scene due to blue barrels filled with chemicals, transported by one of the trucks, catching on fire, causing significant damage to the road surface. Motorists must be cautious of the road surface damage, which might cause other accidents. The body of the deceased is still trapped within the wreckage of the truck. Motorists are urged to use the Stoffberg road. Residents traveling the route has told www.mobserver.co.za that the scene has not been cleared.
