 Local police were seriously out-manned when things got out of hand, but members of the Public Order Policing Unit were quick to arrive. Several fires were set alight but no buildings or structures were damaged. The POP unit managed to disperse the group and several arrests were made. According to a source on the scene, the police and fire department, together with members of community safety groups like AfriForum Dullstroom, are currently on the scene and everything is under control. The R540 is open once again. “We are monitoring the situation and making sure that all fires are put out,” the source said. It is not clear why protesters took to the streets. One rumour is that the youth are unhappy about a lack of job opportunities in the area. A planned community meeting was supposed to happen yesterday but did not take place.
