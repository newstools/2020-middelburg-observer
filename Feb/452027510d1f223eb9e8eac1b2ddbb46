We are still testing the cause of the low pressure in our networks. The services of a pressure expert have since been enlisted to work with our team. We will continuously communicate the progress through our communication platforms. In the meantime, we will continue to supply water to all affected areas through water tankers from 06:00 in the morning until 22:00 evening. Once again, we apologize to the community for the inconvenience and continue to urge the community to use water sparingly. MUNICIPAL MANAGER
