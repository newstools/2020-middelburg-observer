The waste backlog was caused by the go-slow workers staged last Wednesday. The workers demanded that the municipality address the awarding of tenders, road worthlessness of their vehicles, shortage of trucks and personal protective equipment. Workers were also protesting against cadre deployment and outsourcing. â€¢ It is not clear whether all the waste collectors have returned to work.
