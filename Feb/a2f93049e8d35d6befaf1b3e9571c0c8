Unrest erupted from residents who now face day 13 without water as STLM replaces the old asbestos pipeline running from Skietbaan to Graspan. Executive Mayor, Bagudi Tolo, addressed an angry crowd under heavy police surveillance, yet the unrest and road closures remain.  According to information, a second group of protesters have broken away and are headed into town to hand over a memorandum to the cluster commander, over alleged police brutality during protests. Motorists have been warned to avoid Dr Beyers Naud√© Drive in Mhluzi as well as Wes Street, as the march into town progresses.
