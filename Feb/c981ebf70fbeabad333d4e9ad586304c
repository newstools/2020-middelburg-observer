 Waste collectors downed tools on Wednesday. Workers told www.mobserver.co.za that they would not return to work until their demands are met. They are demanding that the municipality address the awarding of tenders, road worthlessness of their vehicles, shortage of trucks and personal protective equipment. Workers are also protesting against cadre deployment and outsourcing. They also say that a tender for the dumpsite was awarded to a company, however, workers have to maintain the site. • Municipal Manager Bheki Khenisa said he spoke to the worker’s leaders on Thursday, who agreed to send him an email with their grievances. He added that they reached an agreement that the workers would go back to work and he would address them on Tuesday, on condition that they return to work in the meantime.
