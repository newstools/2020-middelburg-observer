Sthembiso Amon Mchumu (36) was also declared unfit to carry a firearm. The incident took place in August 2018 and the girl was saved when a group of bricklayers, who were working nearby, heard her scream and came to her rescue. Mchumu fled leaving behind his car. It was later established that the car was rented in Johannesburg, leading to Mchumuâ€™s arrest in Ladysmith four months later.
