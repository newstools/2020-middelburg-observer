 Nicole Swart, a Clubville resident, expressed her frustration with the waste collectors. She said the waste collectors put numerous black bags on her lawn last week but didn’t collect them because of their go-slow. “They place a few bags on our lawn to maybe make collection easier for them, but last week they somehow failed to collect and we had to smell the rotten bags in our driveway the whole week”. Ms Swart said when the waste collectors arrived on Wednesday, they left her lawn a mess. “When I asked one of the men that collected the bags why they didn’t remove the waste, he pointed at me and yelled, ‘It’s your job,’ I was very surprised at his response.” The waste backlog was caused by the go-slow workers staged last Wednesday. The workers demanded that the municipality address the awarding of tenders, road worthlessness of their vehicles, the shortage of trucks and personal protective equipment. Workers were also protesting against cadre deployment and outsourcing.
