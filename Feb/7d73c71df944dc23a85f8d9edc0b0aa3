The municipality restored the water supply with the help of Gradco Engineering last week, after three weeks of water interruptions due to a bulk water supply pipeline which failed. Frustrated residents are concerned about the low water supply they are currently experiencing. The municipality said on Monday that the low water supply is due to a water pipe burst from their main supply. “The Municipality will continue distributing water with water tankers to the affected areas until the situation normalises.”
