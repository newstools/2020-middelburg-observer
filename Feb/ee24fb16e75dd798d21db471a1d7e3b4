 Harry Knoesen, Riana Heymans and Eric and Errol Abram appeared before the Middelburg Magistrates Court on Tuesday. What was supposed to be a quick procedure to postpone the matter for further investigation turned into something completely different, when Knoesen asked to address the court after a postponement date had already been determined. Knoesen told the court that he wishes to end the mandate of his lawyer, Phato Mafatsa from Legal Aid, and that he would be representing himself going forward. He claimed that Mafatsa did not listen to him and did not comply with his instructions.

It is unclear if this incident has anything to do with the breaking down between Knoesen and his lawyer. Magistrate Andreas Masteroudes warned him that he is facing serious charges with a prescribed minimum sentence of life imprisonment. Knoesen replied that he was a learned man who does not have the funds to appoint a private lawyer. He also complained about the state’s investigation, saying that they should have had “their house in order” by now, seeing that they have been investigating him for a year already.

Magistrate Masteroudes asked state prosecutor Derik Rowles to comment on Knoesen’s complaint. Rowles said that circumstances sometimes force authorities to arrest a suspect before the investigation is finalised, for instance, when someone’s life is in danger. He continued to say that the investigation up to now keeps on providing new leads that have to be followed up, but that the state hopes to finalise it soon. The case was postponed until April.
