He retired with a record of 27 wins, including 19 knockouts, 14 losses and two draws. Born on February 11 in 1941, he grew into a 1.83m welterweight and was trained by his late father-in-law Cookie Mendoza.  Kelly began boxing when he was nine years old and turned professional on March 27, 1961, when he changed his name to Spider Kelly. On September 8 1969, he stopped Kosie Wiese before winning the SA welterweight title by stopping Dave Rose in the sixth round. In 1971, Kelly retained the welterweight title against Gert Steyn, and stopped Gielie Buitendag, but lost his title in a return match with Steyn in October. Steyn knocked him out in the eighth round in April 1974. In his last fight, on June 28 that year, Kelly lost on points in a six-rounder against Ronnie du Preez in Welkom and then retired.
