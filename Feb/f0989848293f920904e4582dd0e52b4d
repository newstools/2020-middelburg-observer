 A fuming resident, who reported the issue to the municipality, has watched technicians come and go without the problem being resolved.
The flood of sewerage has been flowing into the yards of residents and into the Klein Olifants River since last week Friday. The problem was reported to STLM on Monday but by Wednesday (today) nothing had been done. According to STLM Media Spokesperson, Prudence Magutle, the issue will be referred immediately.

Areas like Tokologo, Malope Village, parts of Gholfsig, Groenkol and Aerorand, have been left without water for two weeks after a pipeline running from the Skietbaan to Rietfontein had to be replaced. “Just about all of our teams have been dispatched to tend to the water interruptions and this has caused a delay in other maintenance issues,” Ms Magulte explained. “But it’s no excuse and we will attend to the sewer leak as soon as possible.”
