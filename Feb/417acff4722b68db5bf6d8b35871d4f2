 According to TRAC media spokesperson, Solange Soares, the crocodile was found on Saturday at the Arnot off-ramp.
The crocodileâ€™s mouth was taped shut and its legs were tied and a motorist loaded it into their vehicle. This is the second incident this year where a crocodile was found along the N4. An article was published by the Witbank News, after a motorist drove over a crocodile on 7 January at the Ogies off-ramp.

In a media inquiry, both the Herpetological Association as well as the Loskop Nature Reserve stated that they were not informed about the finding of the crocodile.
With two tied up crocodiles found within a month apart, speculations arose of the possibility of animal smuggling. Motorists are urged to contact the Herpetological Association should they come across such instances so that the animals can be safely removed and kept in a safe environment and so that the necessary investigations can be made into these incidents.
