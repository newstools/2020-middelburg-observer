 Much like most social media trends, the game starts with a laugh and ends in tragedy, as friends record themselves jumping with a person in the middle, before sweeping the victim’s feet out from underneath them. The unexpected trip results in the victim falling backwards, striking the back of their scull violently on the floor. The video warns parents of the dangerous game, but does not confirm where the captured incidents took place. After speaking to several local schools, www.mobserver.co.za became aware that most head masters and principals have seen the video.
Each of the schools could confirm that no such incidents have been reported locally. Head master at Laerskool C.R. Swart, Mr Pieter Fauché, said that even though he is not aware of any local incidents, the staff at the school have taken preventative measures by warning pupils of engaging in any dangerous games during their Monday assembly. www.mobserver.co.za has contacted the Department of Education regarding the matter and awaits a response.
