Eskom has announced in a media statement, that despite the late suspension of loadshedding, severe strain on the system might result in blackouts returning. “Eskom has lost additional generation capacity due to unplanned breakdowns. We remind customers that the system remains vulnerable and that loadshedding can be implemented at short notice if there are any additional changes in the system performance. Eskom requests customers to continue to reduce demand and to use electricity sparingly during this period. There is a possibility of increased loadshedding over the next 18 months as we are conducting critical maintenance to restore the ageing plant to good health.” •Should loadshedding be implemented, an update of Middelburg’s schedule will follow.
