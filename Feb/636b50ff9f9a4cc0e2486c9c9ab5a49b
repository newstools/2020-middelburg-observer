According to Provincial Media Spokesperson for the SAPS, Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, the incident occurred at around 15:00 after the teenager was involved in a heated argument with his grandfather. The boy then allegedly went back into the house, where he retrieved his grandfatherâ€™s pellet gun and shot him. The pensioner was declared dead on the scene after paramedics failed to revive him. A preliminary investigation unearthed that the man had a gunshot wound in his upper body and the weapon is busy undergoing ballistic tests. The case docket has been handed over to the Director of Public Prosecution and the teenager is due to appear in court soon.
