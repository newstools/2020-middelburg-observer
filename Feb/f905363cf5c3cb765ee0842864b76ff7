Residents in Mhluzi Extension 4,5,6,7,8, Tokologo, Gholfsig and some parts of Aerorand have been experiencing water supply interruptions due to a bulk water supply pipeline failure during the weekend. The water supply interruptions have now spread to other parts of Mhluzi. The municipality said the water levels at the Graspan Reservoir, which supplies water to Extension 4,5,6,7,8, parts of Gholfsig and some parts of Aerorand, was standing at 20% this morning. Residents will only receive water when the reservoir level is at 55%. “The Rietfontein Reservoir level improved from 0% last night to 31% at 04:00, while the Graspan Reservoir was slightly above 20% this morning at 04:00.”
