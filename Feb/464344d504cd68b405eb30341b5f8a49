Chabalala will appear before the Middelburg Magistrateâ€™s Court on Wednesday. Chabalala was arrested and charged with corruption and bribery after he allegedly attempted to bribe a senior police official to release his luxury vehicle and make a docket related to his other case disappear. He was nabbed in eMalahleni last September where he also faced, among others, a corruption charge. The flamboyant businessman came into national prominence in July 2019 when he took a convoy of 72 cars to the Durban July horse-racing event.
