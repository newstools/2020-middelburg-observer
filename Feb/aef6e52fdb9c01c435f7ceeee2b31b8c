 A warning that accompanied the video said that sharpened spikes, protruding from the road surface, were planted by robbers to force motorists to a halt.
It was claimed that the incident happened on the N4 between Middelburg and Alzu. TRAC spokesperson, Solange Soares, said that after they learnt of the video, the mentioned areas of the N4 were patrolled extensively but that nothing suspicious could be found. She said that they are convinced that the video on social media was not taken on the N4, but rather between Beitbridge and Bulawayo, in Zimbabwe. â€¢ Motorists have however previously been warned to avoid the N4 at night after several incidents of crime were reported. There has been reports of rocks placed on the road surface and also of home-made spikes thrown into the road, both on the N4 and the Van Dyksdrift Road, to cause flat tyres where after motorists have been robbed.
