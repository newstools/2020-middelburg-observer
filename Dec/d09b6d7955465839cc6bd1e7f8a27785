The man was enjoying a night out next to the river banks near the Kees Taljaard sport stadium last week Friday.
He and his wife were very excited to catch a glimpse of nature. He described how the otter pup was trapped on top of the low water bridge in Koppie Street and how the mother kept trying to leap up onto the bridge from down steam, to reunite with her pup. They felt a responsibility to help the pair, but the currents of the river were too strong. This moment was a highlight in their life, which the man described as a miracle. Their sighting was followed by another incident, where a warthog sow paid a visit to the printing factory of the Middelburg Observer. During a strong dour pour of rain on Monday, the hog settled herself down between the press machines and was later rescued by Deon Cornelius from Ubhetyan-O-Africa, who captured her and released her back to the wild. •Read more in this week’s issue of the Middelburg Observer.
