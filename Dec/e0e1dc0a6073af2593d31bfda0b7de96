A sod turning ceremony was held on Friday morning in Mhluzi. The R74 million substation is expected to be completed within two years. Desmond Sondlana, of F-Tech Services, said the construction will start in January. The construction of the station comes after the Gholfsig Sub Station experienced an electrical fire last December.
The fire left thousands of homes in Middelburg and Mhluzi in a blackout for three days. The substation will be located near the Chromville flats. Executive Mayor Bagudi Tolo, said the construction of the sub-station will create 30 short-term positions of employment for residents. “Residents of Mhluzi and the Steve Tshwete Local Municipality have for a while been bearing the brunt of constant power outages,” said Mayor Tolo. The mayor also spoke about the Contractor Development Project that trains and create opportunities for local contractors.
