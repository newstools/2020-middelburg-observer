While power has been fully restored following an explosion at the Gholfsig substation on December 26, pressure on the substation’s capability to supply around 80% of town with electricity, will remain compromised until at least the end of May 2021. The municipality has budgeted R12 million for needed repairs. The materials needed for the stabilization of the substation is however not readily available with the contractor committing to acquire what is needed by the end of January next year. After the 2019 fire at the substation, temporary measures were implemented to ensure no blackouts. Municipal Manager Mr Bheki Khenisa says that the construction of a new substation for Mhluzi, will halve the present dependence on the Gholfsig substation. The substation currently supply 50% of its entire load to Mhluzi. According to studies undertaken by the municipality, the Gholfsig substation will be out of its firm capacity by 2029. Meanwhile, the municipality is still awaiting an insurance payout after the 2019 fire which caused the current predicament. After the fire, temporary units were installed to maintain supply. It was one of the temporary units’ switchgear units that exploded last week, resulting in another blackout. Supply was however restored within 26 hours of the explosion. The Mhluzi substation will become operational in the first quarter of 2022.
