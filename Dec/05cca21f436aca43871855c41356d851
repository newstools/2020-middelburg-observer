Mayor Bagudi Tolo has been admitted to Life Midmed Hospital with Covid-19. Mayor Tolo sought medical assistance at the hospital after feeling unwell for a couple of days. He was immediately tested for Covid-19 with results confirming that the mayor had contracted the virus. Doctors are closely monitoring his health in hospital, where Mayor Tolo will be quarantining. Meanwhile, the municipality has returned to operating with skeleton staff, with those able working from home receiving instruction to do so. The municipality has also announced the closure of Middelburg Dam in an effort to curb rising infections. The municipality is concerned about super spreader events such as weddings, social gatherings and funerals. The municipal law enforcement unit, together with the SAPS, have adopted a zero tolerance approach to lockdown regulation breaches, and have warned that residents who don’t adhere to regulations will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Member of the Mayoral Committee for Infrastructure and Technical Services, Councilor Johan Matshiane, will temporarily take over Mayor Tolo’s duties. Life Midmed has also issued a public warning to residents urging them to stay home. The hospital is at full capacity with daily infections still soaring.
