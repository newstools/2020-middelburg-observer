The unnecessary shooting of Gladness Nothando Chambers (32), on Wednesday last week, unleashed outcry from residents over the continual violence aimed at women, even amid the 16 days of Activism against Gender-based Violence campaign. Ms Chambers was found deceased in a vehicle at the Mhluzi taxi rank in Extension 5 at 02:00 on Wednesday morning, after an armed robbery went wrong.
The police discovered the young mother seated in the passenger seat of a Kia Picanto, with a visible gunshot wound to her shoulder. The man who was with Ms Chambers at the time of her murder, Mr Johannes Mahlangu, blamed two unknown robbers for the crime. Mr Mahlangu described Ms Chambers as a mother who was lovingly devoted to her children and who are now left “motherless, as victims of the country’s ongoing scourge of gender-based violence”.
