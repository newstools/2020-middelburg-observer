As part of the municipalityâ€™s Township Economy Revitalisation Plan, shipping containers are being donated to informal and unregistered businesses, loosely referred to as backyard businesses, so they can utilise them to conduct their businesses more formally. Potential beneficiaries should, however, meet several requirements. The first requirement is that the business must already be operational, even if it is not registered.
Secondly, preference will be given to women, the youth and people with disabilities. Only informal, rural and unregistered businesses should apply. Applicants must also be in a position to pay for transporting the containers to their business premises. Application forms are available at the municipal offices until December 18. Completed forms must be submitted to office B207, on the first floor of the civic centre. For more information, contact Mr Michael Nkosi on 013 249 7153.
