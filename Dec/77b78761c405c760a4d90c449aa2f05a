It is alleged that the suspect colluded with someone who provided her with a credit card which she swiped whenever the motorist was making a cash payment for toll fees at the toll gate and pocketed the cash for herself. She did not honor the monthly payment for the credit card and the allocated credit got depleted. The bank sent notices to the company for non-payment of the credit card which was used at the toll gate. An internal investigation was initiated and it was established that the credit card was used by the suspect and prejudiced the company of more than hundreds of thousands of rands. The matter was referred to the Hawks for further investigation. During the investigation it was established that the co-accused in this matter is an employee of a government institution. His arrest is imminent. The suspect will appear before the Belfast Magistrate Court on Tuesday, 22 December.
