Taxi windows were smashed and tires slashed during the attack around lunchtime. Gunshots were also fired at taxis between Middelburg and Doornkop, whose routes are under dispute. Tens of thousands of rand in damages were incurred by nine taxi owners during Wednesday’s brazen attack. The drivers of the taxis had to flee for their lives, running to the nearby police station for protection, when they were attacked by stone, screwdriver and wheel spanner wielding rivals. The taxis that were damaged are all associated with the Middelburg United Long Distance Taxi Association. The association says that the Middelburg District Taxi Association (MDTA) is behind the attack. According to one of the victims of Wednesday’s attack, the MDTA is trying to “steal” the Doornkop route from them. “They have resorted to violence to effect the coup,” the victim says. Police have warned that further violence would not be tolerated. A number of the damaged taxis are presently grounded. The MDTA denied that it was them stoking the the violence, in stead accusing the Middelburg United Long Distance Taxi Association of interference on their routes. Rival associations have also petitioned the municipality to mediate spiraling tensions.
