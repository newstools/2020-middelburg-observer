The Covid-19 unit at Life Midmed Hospital has reached full occupancy, with strained health professionals warning that the second wave of infections, are even deadlier than the first. “We are filled to capacity, and urge residents to adhere to lockdown regulations to flatten the second, higher curve of infection,” Midmed manager Mr Hennie Viljoen told www.mobserver.co.za today. He says patients are being treated according to the severity of the infection. “Like other hospitals we are in dire need for equipment to be able to treat new patients,” Mr Viljoen says. He says that the spike in cases have shown a dramatic increase of infections since the first wave. “The infection rates are much higher than before, and the symptoms more deadly,” he warns. The hospital’s ICU ward is also at full capacity. “Stay home, protect yourself and your family,” Mr Viljoen urges. Meanwhile, local police have started visiting businesses to ensure Covid-19 lockdown compliance. According to WhatsApp messages doing the rounds, motorists are also being fined R2000 for not wearing masks inside their cars. “Always wear your mask and sanitize religiously,” Mr Viljoen added. Life Midmed presently has 34 patients of which 10 are in ICU, and 15 on ventilators. The hospital has reported three deaths.
