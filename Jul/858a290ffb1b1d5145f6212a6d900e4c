 Video material show police and South African National Defense Force members, going through stacks of airtime in the storeroom of a foreign-owned shop in the Middelburg Central Business District. The video shows how uniformed members go into a ‘free-for-all’ looting frenzy with some grabbing a handful of vouchers and leaving whilst others opted to recharge their phones on the spot by scanning airtime bar codes in the store room.
