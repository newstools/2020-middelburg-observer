 Miscommunication between Puma and the Middelburg Police nearly had him arrested because he was training without a mask. Training for what? Training for the virtual Greatest Train Race of course! Now that Puma has been given a mask, he can keep on training to help raise funds for all his friends at the Middelburg Care Village.
And you can help too by entering for the virtual GTR 2020. •The GTR has been one of Mpumalanga’s most favourite races and for years, a vast number of charity organisations have benefited from the funds raised by this event. The GTR committee has gone beyond the call of duty to bring you the virtual GTR 2020 and to continue to help their beneficiaries during these unprecedented times. To make it worth your while, the GTR 2020 now includes a category for cycling. Here’s how it will work: •Sign up on the website www.gtr.co.za, select your distance and pay the registration fee.
•You will be allowed to complete your run/cycle any time between the 1st of August to the 22nd of August 2020.
•You have to complete the total distance they entered for in one-go.
•After the virtual race, runners post their times online and will then receive their virtual medal & certificate.
•There are real medals and one of a kind buffs available to purchase.
•There are different packages to choose from.
