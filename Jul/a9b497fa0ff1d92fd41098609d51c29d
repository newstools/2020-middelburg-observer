 The father and son duo, Alberto Ernesto Nharreluga (47) and Alberto Erneto Nharreluga (Jnr) (27), were arrested in April 2019 after allegedly being found in possession of two rhino horns and shark fins. The rhino horns and shark fins were found by members of Flying Squad on the N4 next to Belfast, hidden inside a vehicle while the two were travelling from Mozambique to Gauteng. Alberto Erneto Nharreluga (Jnr) During the arrest, the suspects allegedly tried to entice the police officials with a kickback but failed. The Serious Corruption Investigation members were alerted and they processed the crime scene and charged the suspects with possession of endangered species and an additional corruption charge.  Last week Thursday, the Nharrelugaâ€™s attempted to apply for bail but their effort was unsuccessful. Their trial on both crimes, possession of endangered species and corruption, will take place on 28 October this year in the Middelburg Regional Court while they are remanded in custody.
