The Community Service Centre was closed after a staff member tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday. The station was supposed to be closed until Sunday 12 July for the offices to be decontaminated. The CSC temporarily operated out of a back entrance in Beyers Naude Street. After working around the clock to get the building sanitized, including an industrial cleaning, the station was opened more than a day earlier than expected.
