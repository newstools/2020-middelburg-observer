 Steve Tshwete Municipality has closed down its Infrastructure Services situated in the old Nashua building in SADC Street, alongside the public Gerald Sekoto Library at the civic centre, after two officials in each of the affected departments tested positive for the Coronavirus. The municipality says the test results were received on Thursday, confirming the worst. Colleagues of the infected officials were evacuated from their respective places of employment after the test results came in. Both officials have been isolated and are undergoing treatment. The affected offices have already been decontaminated and the municipality says the library and Infrastructure Services will reopen on Monday, July 6. Mayor Bagudi Tolo wishes the employees a speedy recovery and urged the public to stay calm, vigilant and maintain personal safety protocols, to curb a further spread of the virus.
