 According to a press release issued by Middelburg SAPS media spokesperson, Captain Khanyisile Zwane, five residents from Rockdale reported the incident to the police. The residents were at home when they heard a knock at the door. After opening, four men then stormed into the house, one armed with a firearm, and ransacked the property. The suspects made off with their cellphones and a blue BMW, which was parked outside the residence, after locking the victims in the house.
The residents managed to alert their neighbours after breaking open a window. Police responded swiftly after circulating the vehicle and the Flying Squad gave chase. They drove over the pavement at the corner of Keiskama- and Mandela Drive, where all suspects exited the vehicle and fled on foot. The police managed to recover the stolen vehicle and cellphones, but no arrests have been made.
