 The heroin addicted beggar has been on the streets on and off for four years. Www.mobserver.co.za is being inundated with calls from worried residents who want Jarod to get help. His mother lives overseas and the only other family member he has, is his grandmother living in an old age home.
He has been to rehab seven times. He was recently attacked by three thugs who stole all of his blankets and left him with cracked ribs.
Resident’s worry over Jarod was heightened today, after seeing him bent and in visible pain.  Talking to www.mobserver.co.za at his begging spot at the Meyer- and Koets Street intersection, Jarod said he desperately wants to overcome his heroin addiction but because he is destitute, he always ends up on the street, alone and vulnerable, resulting in relapses. “I just want shelter and someone to be there,” he pleaded. Residents who help him with money wield a double edged sword, because their philanthropy pays for his addiction.
Presently he is in need for food and blankets. Hopefully he will be able to enter a local rehabilitation residence in Middelburg next week, after he was told there was no space for him last week, and to return on Monday. Jarod had visited a clinic after the brutal attack at his sleeping spot in the bushes next to the Eastdene stream, and says apart from the rib injuries, he felt fine. He told www.mobserver.co.za that he did not wan’t to die, he wants to live. And thousands of residents agree – Jarod we want you to live!
