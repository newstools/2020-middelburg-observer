The fire brigade was dispatched by bystanders who saw smoke billowing from the little corner shop situated in the parking area of the old taxi rank across from the Shoprite Centre in John Magagula Street. The fire was contained to the shop’s kitchen by the firemen. Apart from smoke damage, the entire shop floor was covered in hot cooking oil. Damage was also done to some kitchen equipment and the deep fryer and microwave were destroyed.
Luckily a large nearby gas bottle was unaffected by the flames. Bystanders told www.mobserver.co.za that neighbouring shops had also been filled with smoke and had to be vacated. No one was injured.
