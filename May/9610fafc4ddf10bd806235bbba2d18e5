 Nowadays, there’s a pill for everything, and while certain illnesses call for medication, wouldn’t you rather kick the habit in a healthy and side-effect-free manner if you had the choice? The Middelburg Observer spoke to a certified hypnotherapist, counsellor and reflexologist, who can offer you help in doing away with the bad habit of smoking, in a stress-free and relaxing environment. Pierre Immelman from Wellness Therapy has been serving as a hypnotherapist in Middelburg since 2014. He explained the myths and facts around hypnotherapy as a treatment, clearing you of any misconceptions towards a practice that has been effective since the early 1700’s. Most people have been introduced to the practice of hypnotherapy as something magical and occultist. A man swings a pendulum before your eyes and the next thing you’re sharing your darkest secrets or robbing a bank. But Mr Immelman describes hypnotherapy as a natural state. One you may find yourself in several times throughout the day. Hypnotherapy is nothing like magic but more science, and certified physicians and therapists have used it for decades to help treat or alleviate pain and illness. To understand hypnotherapy, you first need to understand the different stages of brain frequency between being awake and asleep. The four phases include: •The Beta phase – when you are alert and awake allowing the brain to operate at a frequency above 14 cycles per second •The Alpha phase – a conscious but trans-like state where your brain operates at 7-14 cycles •The Theta phase – where your cycles are significantly decreased and you are unconscious •The Delta phase – which is the equivalent of deep sleep. All people throughout the day often fluctuate between the Alpha and Beta phase. You may have found yourself drifting off into thought while you are driving. That trans-like state, known as the Alpha phase, allows your subconscious mind the freedom to act uninterrupted. Our subconscious mind is frequently passing information to our conscious mind and helps with concentration, calculation, memory retention and decision making. The art of hypnotherapy involves tapping into the Alpha state, where the therapist eases the client into a state of deep relaxation and concentration. During this time you are fully alert and in control of yourself and your environment. Mr Immelman explains how imperative it is for hypnotherapists to get to the root of the underlying problem behind any disorder or bad habit. Allowing yourself to go into the Alpha phase gives you access to your subconscious mind. “Any form of hypnosis is self-hypnosis. No one can be hypnotised against their will. You can also not be forced to do anything that goes against your moral code. You are fully alert and aware at all times, and for hypnotherapy to work you need to be willing for it to work.” He uses hypnotherapy to help cope with or combat the following conditions: • Smoking.

• Fears and phobias.
