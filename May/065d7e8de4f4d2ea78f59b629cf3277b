 Only live-in domestic workers and live in caregivers for children, the elderly and people with disabilities are allowed to return to work. On level 3, only domestic workers who are alone at their employer’s homes throughout the day, will be allowed to go to work.
Gardeners and pool services will also be allowed back to work on level 3. All other domestic workers, like those working on weekends or limited days, will only be allowed back on level 2. Hundreds of domestic workers and gardeners returned to work over the weekend. If they do not live on the property and take care of children, the elderly or the disabled, they’re not allowed back.
Residents can face fines of up to R10 000, a prison sentence, or both. The municipality still issues essential services permits, which is still needed to go to work during level 4.
