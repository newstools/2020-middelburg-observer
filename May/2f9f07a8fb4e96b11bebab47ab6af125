 One resident, who feared a physical altercation, called for the police, who later appeared to monitor the situation. Upon arrival, www.mobserver.co.za was bombarded by queuing residents with complaints. The customers all found themselves in one long queue at 08:00 in the morning, that slowly moved forward as people were let in. Their complaint towards the sheer arrogance under security guards, came after members of security started splitting up the queues into two different lines. Multitudes of queuing taxpayers, who had been standing in front of the queue, were suddenly moved to the back of the line, as security guards randomly selected certain members to go in, with no system of order. By 12:00, the same members were moved back yet again as the lines were divided into four. One resident, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that they understand that the municipality is functioning on skeleton staff. “There is no sense of urgency and no one is inside. How is it possible that the municipality can only let five people in between 08:00 and 11:00? Why does it take them so long to serve customers?” Another resident acknowledged that when he finally gained entry, he overheard one of the tellers saying that they “must leave them to stand outside”. “Why can someone of higher authority not address the situation and explain to us what the hold up is? Can’t they provide a numerical system that keeps track of who was here first? The queuing system is now in total chaos and we continue to stand in the sun for hours as security keeps meddling with the lines.” www.mobserver.co.za contacted the municipality for comment, but no response was given by the time of publication.
