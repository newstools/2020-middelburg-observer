  Minister Zulu visited the shelter, set up at the Eastdene Community Centre, this morning. In an interview later, minister Zulu said that she wished that what she saw at the Middelburg shelter, happens in all shelters across the country. During a conversation with one of the homeless currently living in the shelter, minister Zulu said to him “Your goverment is whith you, but you also have to do everything you can to help yourself.” She warned that recipients of the Covid-19 grant should not abuse the money. “It is not for anyone of you to get the money and then start thinking of going out again, finding drugs and doing all those things,” minister Zulu said.  She said that persons over the age of 18, in possession of an identity book or identity number, who is currently not receiving any other money from government and who is unemployed, qualifies for the grant. She later explained that the nine people paid, was only to test the system in each province. “We had to make sure the system is tight. Thousands have now been cleared for SARS for payment,” the minister said. Minister Zulu touched on the recent court application against her regarding the distribution of food. She said that it is unfortunate that she was taken to court as she does not have the time for people to delay her from doing her job. “The fact is we cannot stop anyone from supporting communities. The challenge is to stick to Covid protocols. Make sure the food is nutritious and safe, make sure you treat people with dignity. It is our responsibility to ensure that people are treated with dignity.” Minister Lindiwe Zulu gets her temperature taken during her visit to the homeless shelter in Middelburg.
