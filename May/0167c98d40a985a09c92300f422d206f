 Nothing is set in stone yet and an announcement of which departments will be open to the public will be communicated later this week. Only 30% of the municipality’s entire workforce will be allowed back to work. Presently the municipality is sanitising all public spaces within the municipality ahead of the re-opening of the departments next week. No decisions have been taken about the opening of the town planning department for the public yet, though personnel will also return to work next week. Municipal spokesperson Ms Prudence Magutle says that the municipality is still on Level 5 lockdown regulations for the remainder of the week. She said that management is still deciding on which staff members will be allowed back, and how much public access to allow to the respective departments. “We will confirm which department will be opened to the public by the end of the week,” she told www.mobserver.co.za, adding that a detailed layout of services would be given to www.mobserver.co.za to inform the public. Once the civic centre has been sanitised and opened to the public, strict social distancing rules will apply while strict access control, to control numbers, will be implemented.
