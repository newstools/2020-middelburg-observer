The school boasts with a sanitizing tunnel, donated by Neels Liddle of Waterzone. An allocated drop-off area, with stickers to indicate the correct social distance and a screening station before you enter the tunnel, have been set up at the schoolâ€™s entrance.  Headmaster Gerrie van der Merwe says that they have made sufficient plans to ensure they meet government requirements.
