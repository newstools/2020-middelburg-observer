 Two cellphone numbers have been placing calls to community development workers, ward councillors and local businesses, claiming that they have been appointed by the municipality or the Department of Health. The scammers state that they have been appointed to do sanitising and cleaning of municipalities, hospitals and schools and that they are in need of bakkies with canopies. A contribution of R6000 is asked and banking details are provided during the call. The cellphone numbers that have been used for the scam are as follows: 076 518 6083 or 079 296 3475. The Executive Mayor assures all residents that the operation is being conducted illegally and is not driven by the municipality or Department of Health.
Any residents who receive similar calls are urged to contact the SAPS immediately and report the scammers.
