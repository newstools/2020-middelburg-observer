The Department of Water and Sanitation would like to remind the public that South Africa is a water scarce country therefore it is important to use the available water in a wise, sparing and conservative manner for water security, especially as we go to the dry winter season in most parts of the country. Water supply security is in everybodyâ€™s hands, so let us all be responsible and take care of the little water we have and our water resources.
