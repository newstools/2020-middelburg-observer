Morgan Lewis explains that the thief broke into their premises at around 08:00 Tuesday morning. The video shows how the perpetrator gained access by forcing their gate open with an iron rod that he found in the street. He ran into the garage, which was standing open at the time after someone had just left the property. The thief managed to make off with a cordless grinder and a bluetooth speaker, before Morganâ€™s mother-in-law saw the thief and started screaming.
