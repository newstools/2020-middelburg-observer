 The United Nations Childrenâ€™s Fund (UNICEF), in partnership with the National Department of Education, established the TechnoGirl mentorship programme in 2005. The initiative identifies high school girls between the ages of 15 and 18 from disadvantaged communities who are performing well academically. Columbus selected 12 learners from Ekwazini Secondary School and Phumelela Secondary School. The three-year programme will take place during the school holidays, it will include job shadowing, mentoring soft-skills training and workplace exposure.
The stainless steel giant will also expose the girls to career guidance which will help them identify their career interests. At the end of the programme, the girls will go onto the Alumni Association where additional support and guidance will be provided to them.
