www.mobserver.co.za has received a barrage of complaints from business owners since level 4 lockdown restrictions were announced, saying that the SAPS is forcing businesses allowed to operate on level 4 to close, tearing up their permits and threatening them with arrest. According to the owner of Funky Toys & Things, she obtained permission from a police captain to reopen her business by only allowing the sale of essential goods like blankets, heaters and fuel-fired stoves. During an inspection by the traffic department on Friday, she was also given the go-ahead after she barricaded her non-essential goods. Later she was, however, forced to close by the police, who said that she needed a municipal permit to trade, with the municipality strongly disagreeing.
