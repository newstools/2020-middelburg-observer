 Mkhulu Combined School in Doornkop is not one of those schools. One of the school’s governing body members, Elman Mtau, told the Middelburg Observer that pupils in Doornkop are left at a disadvantage because they cannot afford data. “Data is not the only problem, some of these children don’t even have smartphones to access the internet,” said Mr Mtau. The fact that pupils don’t have internet access makes it impossible for them to receive any sort of communication from the school. Mr Mtau also added that the only thing the learners can do at this stage is to watch lessons on the television, and those with no TV listen to educational shows on the radio. “At this point, there is nothing we can do,” said Mr Mtau. The Department of Education is yet to announce when schools will be reopened.
