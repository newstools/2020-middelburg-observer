 A resident from Gholfsig was furious when she contacted www.mobserver.co.za, stating that homes in Wassenaar Street, Vermaas Street and Van Elders Street, have all been informed by the municipal SMS notification system, that Steve Tshwete Local Municipality is working on the issue, and that the estimated restoration time is three hours. Residents from these streets have been sitting without water for three days. Earlier this week, it was confirmed that the interruption of water supply was due to a pipe leak in Van Elders Street. Later on, STLM notified residents that frequent interruptions in electricity, due to loadshedding, has resulted in reservoir levels dropping. www.mobserver.co.za has contacted STLM but received no response by the time of publishing.
