On Thursday morning officials stopped motorists using the Middelburg Toll Plaza for screening.
The province currently has eight confirmed cases of the novel virus. MEC of Health, Sasekani Manzini, was also on the forefront of testing motorists.  The MEC said the department decided to conduct the tests at one of the province’s busiest toll plazas. “People in the province are worried, so we decided to conduct the screening so that those with symptoms can get tests at the hospital,” said MEC Manzini. Motorists with symptoms will be transported to the hospital where more tests will be conducted.
