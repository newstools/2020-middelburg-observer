 School headmaster Gerrie van der Merwe said in a letter posted on social media that the parent resides in Johannesburg. He was tested for Covid-19 on Tuesday 17 March and informed the school on Wednesday 18 March. His son, who attends Middelburg Laerskool was in contact with him over the weekend. What is concerning is that the boy attended school on Monday 16 March and Tuesday 17 March, before the school was closed. The child attended the class of teacher Laverne Hattingh. Mr Van der Merwe said that “there is no reason for panic. The relevant authorities have been alerted”. He advised learners and parents who experience symptoms to get tested as soon as possible.
