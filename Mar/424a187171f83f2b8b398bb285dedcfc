 “The most important thing is maintaining a safe environment for everyone at our mall, and we will be taking all necessary precautions as we stay open to serve our customers,” assures General Manager of Middelburg Mall, Mike Tammadge. The mall is following the World Health Organisation’s recommended preventative protocols and the advice of local health authorities. “We are watching the COVID-19 situation closely, and particularly any potential impact within our local community. We are keeping open lines of communication and monitoring updates from the relevant local, provincial and national authorities as this situation evolves. Middelburg Mall is committed to taking the necessary actions based on official guidance, and will continue to put the health and safety of our customers and community first,” says Tammadge. The mall has increased the frequency and intensity of cleaning and sanitising in all common areas, and especially touchpoints and areas with high traffic. It is using recommended cleaning agents. Hand sanitiser stations will be placed throughout the mall to assist with personal hygiene practices. This is what you can do to look after your health: •Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol-based sanitiser. •Don’t shake hands •Avoid touching your mouth, nose and eyes with unwashed hands. •Cover your coughs and sneezes with your flexed elbow or a tissue (and then throw it away immediately and safely). •If you feel sick, stay home and seek medical attention. “Our primary concern is the health and safety of the people who shop, visit and work at the mall. The COVID-19 situation is unfolding day by day and we are working hard on our contingency plans and extra safety measures. We will follow the official health advice of the relevant local authorities and share updates and changes immediately,” reassures Tammadge.
