 This comes after a fake message was circulated on social media, telling of three Middelburg residents testing positive for the COVID-19 virus, one in Life Midmed Hospital and two in the Middelburg Provincial Hospital. Mr Dumisani Malamule told www.mobserver.co.za that only two cases have been reported in the Mpumalanga region. One person tested positive in Nelspruit and the other Malelane. Both patients are under self-quarantine in their own homes. The Department of Health and local medical institutions have once again made an appeal to the public to refrain from spreading fake news about the coronavirus. Should anyone suspect that they have been infected with COVID-19, the following steps should be taken for testing and treatment: •Contact the National Institution for Communicable Diseases (NICD) on 080 002 9999 and follow instructions. •Any person who undergoes testing, whose results return as negative will be held liable to pay a fee of between R1200 – R1400.
Medical schemes will only cover fees for testing when results come back as positive for the COVID-19 virus. Also read: President Cyril Ramaphosa: ‘Schools to be closed from Wednesday’ Coronavirus – Frequently asked questions and answers from the Center of Disease Control and Prevention
