  During their visit they told Community Policing Forum Chair, Rehana Pilodia as well as the homeless people, whom has now grown to about 100, that they will provide the food until 1 April. They also gave sanitary goods, toiletries, backpacks and blankets to them. A lot of non perishable food was also given to the CPF, which can be used from when they hand over to them on 2 April. Ms Pilodia thanked the MEC of Social Development, Ms Blessing Thandi  Shongwe for their generous donation. She said that this will give the members from the CPF, who has been working day and night to help the homeless at the stadium, a chance to take a break. *This drive was done in collaboration with the MMC of Social Services, Mr Johan Matshiane. *Just before the MEC’s arrival big donations were also made by the owners of Tosca (in Kanonkop) and the Restoration Church of Life For All (RFOLFAN) in partnership with the Yethembe Group. *Olifants River Lodge just dropped of pizzas and other food at the Bambanani Medical Centre. *It was asked again that all daily donations are taken to the Bambanani Medical Centre where food is prepared for the homeless people. They do not want people to go to the to Kees Taljaard Stadium in the fight to help flatten the Covid-19 curve.
