The announcement was not well received by the group of about 100 homeless people.  They were transported with the help of DA Ward Councillor, Damien Klopperâ€™s truck and police vehicles to a nearby church ground where security is better.  Municipal officials, ward councillors, members of sector 1 Community Policing Forum, Middelburg SAPS and the fire department were present during the move.
