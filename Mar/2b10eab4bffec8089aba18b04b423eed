The three suspects ran into the long arm of the law, after the Police spotted a VW Polo, fitting the description of the suspected vehicle. The police pursued the vehicle, which had three occupants in it and after the driver refused to stop for authorities, a high speed chase ensued. The Provincial Commissioner of the SAPS, Lt. Gen. Mondli Zuma, applauded the combined efforts by the police as well as Tracker Connect. Also read: Motorists robbed after spikes are thrown onto N4 near Bronhorstspruit Despite their breakthrough, Lt.
