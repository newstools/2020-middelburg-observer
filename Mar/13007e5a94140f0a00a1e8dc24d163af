 On Monday hundreds of elderly persons queued at the Post Office to collect their grants, many were in the queue from 06:00. The government said that it had taken the necessary measures to reduce congestion and ensure that there would be social distancing protocols at pay points, however, when the www.mobserver.co.za visited the Post Office many residents were not practicing social distancing. The elderly stood in long queues to get their social grant from the Post Office in the CBD. The elderly and disabled SASSA beneficiaries will receive their social grants over the next two days, while other grants, including child support, will be collected from 1 April. People in need of the pharmacies and banks across town had snake-like queues.  Meanwhile, the Mhluzi Police were monitoring queues at the eMhluzi Mall for those purchasing groceries. The Iraq Taxi Rank, which is usually busy, was eerily quiet in the morning.
