 In line with public health advice, Parkrun SA has taken the decision to close all parkrun events across South Africa, Namibia, and Eswatini with immediate effect. Initially, this closure will be in place until the end of March, however this is largely to bring all parkrun countries into the same time frame and it is expected that closures will continue throughout the month of April. Going forward we will update parkrunners regularly and aim to communicate important information as soon as is appropriate. * Notice: Coronavirus reporting at Caxton Local Media aims to combat fake news Dear reader, As your local news provider, we have the duty of keeping you factually informed on Covid-19 developments.
