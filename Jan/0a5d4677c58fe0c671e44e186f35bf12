Entry to the business was gained through a hole in a window situated in the corridor that runs between Auto Spares and Galitoâ€™s. There are allegations that the guard, who sat metres from where thieves gained entry to the business, was drugged. One of the first responders on the scene said that upon his arrival the guard appeared confused. He was taken to hospital for tests. Auto Spares Middelburg did not want to comment about the break-in or what was stolen at the time of going to press.
