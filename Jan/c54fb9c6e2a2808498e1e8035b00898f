 One resident aired his disgrace stating that since the power outage, they have had no network or water, as a result of the power cut. As the town’s people reported the problem, the Pullenshope power station insisted that the fault did not lie with them and that it was the municipality who was working on cable faults. Eskom media spokesperson, Juanita Vogel, informed www.mobserver.co.za, that the power outage is a result of a municipal cable fault.
Eskom was requested to switch off their breakers, allowing municipal technicians to work on the cables. “The breakers have recently been turned back on and now the municipality needs to switch on the electricity from their side.” STLM media spokesperson, Prudence Magutle, informed www.mobserver.co.za that the municipality is aware of the problem. It cannot yet be confirmed when electricity will be restored to Hendrina.
