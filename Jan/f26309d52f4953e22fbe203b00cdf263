 The chase around 13:30 today, ended in Weeber Street where the driver of the speeding VW crashed into the railway line.
All occupants of the VW then fled on foot with police in hot pursuit. One of the occupants sustained an ankle wound during the ensuing shootout.
He was treated by paramedics on the scene before being taken to hospital.  A crying woman arrived on the scene, claiming that the car hadn’t been hijacked, but in fact taken by her son.
She refused to identify herself or the boy to www.mobserver.co.za. The mother didn’t want to speculate why the boy fled from the SAPS, or how many occupants was present in the car when it crashed into the railway line.
Bystanders say the wounded man was definitely in the car with a driver.  A wide area search was undertaken but the suspects all succeeded in evading arrest. • Read more in this week’s edition of the Middelburg Observer.
