 The Mhluzi Police spokesperson, Sergeant Thabitha Leshilo, said the police received a call from a resident on January 5.
Upon investigation, the police found the discarded foetus in a plastic bag covered by sand. A case of birth concealment is being investigated following the incident. • Steve Tshwete Local Municipality workers found a dead infant in a manhole behind Ekwazini Secondary School last November. The solid waste workers received a complaint about the manhole being blocked, when they arrived on the scene they discovered the lifeless body of a baby inside the manhole. • Last September a foetus was discovered by recyclers that were rummaging through the rubbish heaps at the Tokologo dumpsite.
The foetus was also found in a plastic bag. Vulnerable mothers are urged not to perform illegal abortions or dump their babies. Mhluzi has a baby safe at the Mhluzi Medical Centre on the corner of Chocolate Street and Mandela Drive.
