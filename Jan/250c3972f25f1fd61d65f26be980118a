 Harry Knoesen, Riana Heymans and brothers Eric and Errol Abrams were arrested in November 2019 on charges relating to the terrorism act. Knoesen’s legal representative, Mr Mafatsa, told the court that they are not ready to proceed with bail and asked for a postponement. Heymans indicated during a previous court proceeding that she will not be applying for bail at this stage and thus was not present in court today. Also read: Harry Knoesen and Abram brothers appear in court for bail applications The Abram brothers proceeded with their bail application, handled by adv. BC Bester. Specialist prosecutor adv. RC Macadam acted on behalf of the state. Adv. Bester read two affidavits, one from each of his clients, into the record whilst the state handed in affidavits by the investigating officer as well as a police officer who was present during the Abrams’ arrest, as evidence. Both councils have handed in heads of argument and addressed the court. The matter is standing down for the moment with judgement expected later today.
