Road users soon started warning each other of the sudden reduction, after traffic officials capitalised on the occasion with a speed trapping ambush, long before the speed reduction was common knowledge. Media Spokesperson for TRAC N4, Solange Soares, confirmed that a temporary speed reduction had been put into place, to prevent accidents under unfavourable weather conditions. The speed limit was reduced to 100km p/h last week, on a section of the N4, spanning from the Shell Ultra City outside Middelburg to the off-ramp at the Ridge Casino.
According to Ms. Soares, the speed limit has reverted back to 120km p/h.
