 According to Captain Khanyisile Zwane, Alex Botsira-Mutsuri was driving on the N11 with a load of sand at around 09:05 when a white Toyota Hilux approached from the back with flashing lights. Mr Botsira-Mutsuri decided to stop. A man approached the driver’s door and pointed a firearm at him. He was ordered to move to the passenger seat whilst the armed man got in behind the steering wheel. Another man climbed into the truck on the passenger side and tied Mr Botsira-Mutsuri’s hands together and ordered him to lie behind the seat. The hijackers drove off with the victim still in the truck. After travelling for some time, they stopped the truck and dumped the load of sand on the back, before driving off again. Mr Botsira-Mutsuri was later dropped off next to the road. He walked to a nearby farm for help. A Be-On-The-Lookout (BOLO) was issued later that day by community safety groups after the truck was spotted on the R33 (Stoffberg-Groblersdal road) and later again on the R555 (Stoffberg-Middelburg road) passing Laerskool Uitkyk. The truck has since vanished. According to information from a community member, the hijackers were armed with 9mm pistols and an AK47. The victim recalled that the hijackers spoke Sjangaan. Capt. Zwane said that the Middelburg Police are investigating a charge of hijacking and kidnapping. The truck is said to be valued at more than R500 000.
