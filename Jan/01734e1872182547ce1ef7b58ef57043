 Mr David Nonyana, overseer at Middelburg Dam, explained that the Middelburg area enjoyed a rainfall of 72.4 mm from Monday 6 January until Monday 13 January.
The sluice gates were opened on Friday afternoon and were kept open throughout the weekend until Sunday. Despite the three-day-long purge, the dam level stood at 94.92% full after being measured at 08:00 this morning. Mr Nonyana reported that since the last reading, an intake of 10 mm per hour was received between 08:00 and 09:00 this morning. The frequent opening of sluice gates at the Middelburg Dam during the months of December and January has resulted in a high volume of visitors flocking to the dam. Mr Nonyana expressed that as much as they welcome their visitors, the staff at Middelburg Dam have witnessed unfortunate incidents of pollution, littering and vandalism by members of the public. “Middelburg Dam belongs to all of us as a community and we need to take pride in our environment and keep it clean”. He appeals to members of the public to share responsibility in maintaining the Middelburg Dam and keeping it a family friendly recreational area.
